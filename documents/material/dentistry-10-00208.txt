Abstract: A dental luting material aids in the retention and stability of indirect restorations on the
prepared tooth structure. In dentistry, clinicians are using a wide range of luting materials for the
cementation of indirect restorations. Zinc oxide eugenol and non-eugenol cements, zinc phosphate
cement, zinc polycarboxylate cement, glass ionomer cement and resin cements are common dental
cements used in dentistry. Each luting material or cement possesses unique properties and clinical
implications. An ideal luting cement should be biocompatible, insoluble, resistant to thermal and
chemical assaults, antibacterial, aesthetic, simple and easy to use. It should have high strength
properties under tension, shear and compression to resist stress at the restoration–tooth interface, as
well as adequate working and setting times. So far, no luting material possesses all of these properties
of an ideal cement. Scientists have been modifying the conventional luting cements to improve the
material’s clinical performance and developing novel materials for clinical use. To achieve the best
clinical outcome, clinicians should update their knowledge and gain a good understanding of the
luting materials so that they can make a wise clinical decision on the material selection and obtain an
insight into the development of luting cements. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a
discussion on the physical, chemical, adhesive and aesthetic properties of common luting materials.
The clinical indications of these luting materials are suggested based on their properties. In addition,
overviews of the modiﬁcation of the conventional luting materials and the newly developed luting
materials are provided.

A luting cement is a material that is used to attach indirect restorations to prepared
tooth surfaces by ﬁlling minute voids between the restorations and the tooth structures,
thereby locking the restoration mechanically to prevent dislodgement [1,2]. A luting mate-
rial provides the retention of indirect restorations by providing mechanical interlocking,
chemical bonding or both of them. Traditional cementation rely mostly on the frictional
forces between the prepared tooth surfaces and ﬁtting walls of restorations [3]. More
contemporary materials utilize chemical and micromechanical adhesion to bond between
the tooth surface, cement and restorative material [4].

Understanding the properties of the luting materials and their clinical indications is
helpful to ensure the quality of the cementation. The luting materials create the seal between
the restoration and the tooth. A good seal is important not only to hold the restoration in
place but also to make the surface impervious to microleakage and caries. Hence, luting
materials affect the longevity of indirect restorations. In addition, the luting materials
are widely indicated in the cementation of crowns, inlays, onlays, veneers, multiple-
unit ﬁxed prostheses, endodontic posts and orthodontic appliances. It is essential for
dental practitioners to comprehend the clinical indications of the common luting materials.
Therefore, this review aims to provide a discussion on the physical, chemical, adhesive
and aesthetic properties of common luting materials. The clinical indications of these

luting materials are suggested based on their properties. In addition, overviews of the
modiﬁcation of the conventional luting materials and the newly developed luting materials
is provided.

2. Historical Development of Common Luting Cements

Over the past 50 years, a range of new materials has been developed which are known
as luting cements. However, before this period, zinc phosphate had been the only choice of
material for permanent cement for almost 100 years since the late 19th century. Therefore,
it is often regarded as the “gold standard” for permanent dental cements [5]. In the late
1960s, zinc polycarboxylate was introduced, which offered more options of luting material
to clinicians at that time [3]. Contemporary cements shifted from the utilization of a
bonding mechanism to luting (ﬁlling in the space between the tooth and the restoration).
Between the 1970s and the 1980s, glass ionomer cement (GIC) and resin-modiﬁed glass
ionomer cement (RMGIC) was invented. Resin cement, which was invented in the 1950s,
has undergone many reformulations and improvements over the years. Owing to the
increasing demand for aesthetic all-ceramic restorations, it has gained high popularity in
contemporary dentistry [5]. In the 2000s, self-adhesive resin cement was developed to
simplify the clinical procedure of traditional resin cements [6]. Calcium aluminate/glass
ionomer cement (CaAl/GI) has a bioactivity property by creating hydroxyapatite crystals,
and this was introduced in 2009 [7–9]. An ideal luting cement should be biocompatible,
insoluble, resistant to thermal and chemical assaults, antibacterial, aesthetic, simple and
easy to use. It should have high strength properties under tension, shear and compression
to resist the stress at the restoration–tooth interface, as well as adequate working and setting
times. So far, no luting material possesses all of these properties of an ideal cement.

3. Classiﬁcation of the Luting Materials

The luting materials can generally be classiﬁed by their chemical compositions, bond-
ing mechanisms or clinical indications. Luting materials can be classiﬁed as water- or
resin-based luting cements based on their chemical composition. Water-based materials
include zinc-oxide eugenol and non-eugenol, zinc polycarboxylate, zinc phosphate, GIC
and hybrid CaAl/GI cements. Resin-based luting cements include conventional and self-
adhesive resin cements. RMGIC, which has the properties of GIC and resin cements, is a
mix of water- and resin-based cement.

Luting materials can also be classiﬁed as non-adhesive, chemically adhesive and mi-
cromechanically adhesive luting agents by means of a bonding mechanism. Non-adhesive
luting materials achieve restoration by friction only. Chemically adhesive luting materials
can establish molecular interactions with the tooth structures to form chemical bonding,
whereas micromechanically adhesive materials accomplish adhesion via micromechanical
interlocking between the adhesive and the tooth surfaces [10]. Non-adhesive cements
include zinc oxide eugenol and non-eugenol and zinc phosphate cements. Chemically
adhesive materials include zinc polycarboxylate, GIC and hybrid CaAl/GI cements. Both
types of resin cement are micromechanically adhesive materials. RMGIC can be both
chemically adhesive and micromechanically adhesive.

Based on the clinical indication, luting materials can be categorized into temporary or
permanent cements. Temporary cements are used to retain provisional restorations, and
these include zinc oxide eugenol and non-eugenol and zinc polycarboxylate [11] (Table 1).
The permanent cements include zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, GIC, RMGIC,
conventional and self-adhesive resin cement and hybrid CaAl/GI cement. They are used
in the cementation of deﬁnitive restorations (Table 2).

4.1. Zinc Oxide Eugenol and Non-Eugenol Cements

Zinc oxide eugenol has a two-component system and sets in an acid–base reaction.
The powder contains zinc oxide, along with a minute amount of other zinc salts and abietic
acids to increase the working time and strength of it. The liquid contains eugenol and
acetic acid, the latter of which acts as an accelerator [14]. There are numerous advantages
to using zinc oxide eugenol as a temporary cement. Its low strength allows for the easy

Dent. J. 2022, 10, 208

5 of 16

removal of provisional crowns. It also has sedative properties to the dental pulp and a
good marginal seal, and it is cost-effective [14,35]. Although several laboratory studies
and a systematic review have shown that the use of eugenol-containing temporary cement
does not alter the bond strength of resin [35–38], one common concern about zinc oxide
eugenol is that eugenol hinders the polymerization of resin cement and leads to a reduced
bond strength [15,39]. To avoid disrupting the polymerization of a composite resin, it is
suggested to use zinc oxide non-eugenol as a temporary cement before the composite resin
application. It uses acids such as aliphatic acid or butyric acid to substitute the eugenol in
the acid–base reaction [14].

4.2. Zinc Phosphate

Zinc phosphate has the longest history of use in dentistry and is often regarded as
the “gold standard” for permanent dental cements [5]. It is essentially made of zinc oxide
and magnesium oxide powders with a liquid consisting of phosphoric acid, water and
aluminum phosphate [40]. Being a non-adhesive luting agent, it does not bond to the tooth
structure and restorative materials and merely acts by providing mechanical interlocking [3].
It has moderate compressive strength and a high modulus of elasticity [41,42]. Having a
high mechanical strength upon setting, it is a good choice for the cementation of a cast metal
post-core [43]. It can also be used to cement all-metal or metal-supported restorations with
good mechanical retention results [43,44]. The disadvantages of zinc phosphate outweigh
the advantages, and its use in contemporary dentistry is quite limited. Like other water-
based cements, zinc phosphate sets by means of an acid–base reaction. Due to the presence
of phosphoric acid, the initial pH of the setting cement is very low (<2.0 min), and this may
cause sensitivity during and after cementation. Moreover, the reaction is highly exothermic
and could possibly irritate the pulp. It can also undergoes discoloration and has relatively
weak mechanical properties when it is compared to the contemporary cements [44]. There is
also a higher chance of secondary caries occurring in zinc phosphate-cemented restorations
due to its water solubility and its inability to inhibit bacterial growth [45].

4.3. Zinc Polycarboxylate

Zinc polycarboxylate was developed in 1968 with the goal to develop a dental cement
that has the strength of zinc phosphate with the adhesiveness and biocompatibility of
zinc oxide eugenol [14,46]. It consists of zinc oxide and polyacrylic acid in a powder and
liquid system, which sets via an acid–base reaction in an aqueous environment. During
the reaction, zinc crosslinks the polyacrylic acid chains and leads to the setting of the
cement [47]. Because the carboxylic groups of the polyacrylic acid chains can chelate the
calcium in hydroxyapatite, it can create a form of a chemical bond to mineralize the hard
tissues [48,49]. However, the chemical adhesion of it is weak, and the retention of it is
primarily mechanical [6]. The major advantages of zinc polycarboxylate are that it is less
irritating to the pulp and has a higher tensile strength when it is compared to the traditional
zinc phosphate. However, its compressive strength is only one-half to two-thirds of that of
zinc phosphate. Its modulus of elasticity is also much lower than that of zinc phosphate.
Thus, it may display signiﬁcant plastic deformation upon long-term loading [10]. Moreover,
it has low resistance to acidic erosion and should not be used in patients with gastric reﬂux
problems or who frequently consume an acidic diet [50]. Inferior handling properties due
to it having a high degree of viscosity and it needing a short working time (2.5 min) are also
considered as its clinical disadvantages, especially when one is cementing multiple-unit
restorations [13]. Therefore, despite originally being developed as a permanent cement,
the main application of polycarboxylate cement today is for the long-term maintenance
of provisional restorations or when maximum retention is needed for the provisional
restoration, such as when the retention form of the tooth preparation or the quality of the
provisional restoration is not satisfactory [2].

4.4. Glass Ionomer Cement
4.4.1. Conventional Glass Ionomer Cement

Conventional GIC (glass ionomer cement, GIC), which is ofﬁcially known as glass
polyalkenoate cement, is made of calcium ﬂuoro-alumino-silicate glass powder combined
with a water-soluble polycarboxylic acid [51]. In the 1990s, GIC was modiﬁed with ﬁne
glass particles and high molecular weight anhydrous polyacrylic acid [52]. Tartaric acid
is added to increase the working time of it and facilitate the setting reaction to improve
the post-setting hardness [53]. After mixing, GIC sets by an acid–base reaction where the
carboxyl ion of the polycarboxylic acid forms ionic bonds with aluminum and calcium
ions in ﬂuoro-alumino-silicate glass powder. Gelation of the cement begins and continues
until the cement hardens [54]. On top of the mechanical retention, GIC can form molecular
adhesion to the tooth structure by the chelation with calcium and phosphate ions. An
important feature of GIC is ﬂuoride release. In the reaction, ﬂuoride is released into an
aqueous environment with an initial burst over the ﬁrst 24 h, and this gradually slows down
to a long-term release. Owing to its ﬂuoride-release property, the most valuable advantage
of GIC is its anticariogenic property, which aids in preventing secondary caries [55]. It
is also biocompatible with the dental pulp [56]. However, its strength properties are
unsatisfactory. It has low ﬂexural strength and a high modulus of elasticity, making it
brittle and prone to bulk fractures [57]. Being a water-based cement, its solubility in oral
ﬂuid and microleakages are still issues [12]. Additionally, similar to zinc phosphate, the
low initial pH of setting GIC can contribute to postoperative sensitivity [58,59]. Therefore,
it is suggested that one uses dentine sealers, such as resin-based bonding agents for pulpal
protection, when GIC is used and when the remaining dentine thickness is minimal [60].

4.4.2. Resin-Modiﬁed Glass Ionomer Cement

With the desire to improve the shortcomings of conventional GIC, RMGIC was devel-
oped to combine the strength and hydrophobicity of resin with the valuable ﬂuoride-release
ability of GIC. Monomers such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) are added into the
liquid component of GIC, along with an associated photo-sensitive initiator system [61].
RMGIC is described to be “dual-cured”, where resin monomers undergo photopolymeriza-
tion upon light curing, and the GIC component is chemically cured in an acid–base reaction.
The polymerized resin acts as a bridge and strengthens the material [54]. In addition to the
chemical bonding that is achieved by polycarboxylates, RMGIC can also achieve microme-
chanical interlocking in hybridized dentine through the inﬁltration of the collagen network
that is exposed by 10% polyacrylic acid [62]. This creates a greater bond strength and higher
fracture toughness values than conventional GIC can, although the mechanical properties
are still inferior to the resin cement [63]. On the other hand, the ﬂuoride release from
RMGIC follows a similar pattern to that of conventional GIC with an initial burst during
the ﬁrst 24 h [64,65]. Although the amount varies by product, its ﬂuoride release potential
can be comparable to that of conventional GIC, retaining the anticariogenic property of
conventional GIC [66,67]. The addition of resin is not without its downside. Several studies
have compared the effects of conventional GIC and RMGIC on pulpal tissues, and the
results have shown that RMGIC is more cytotoxic to pulp cells [68–70]. Therefore, RMGIC
cannot be considered to be as biocompatible as conventional GIC is [71].

4.4.3. Hybrid Calcium Aluminate/Glass Ionomer Cement

Hybrid CaAl/GIC is a water-based permanent cement that is composed of calcium
aluminate and glass ionomer mixed with distilled water [72]. It is a self-adhesive material
without the need for any pre-treatment procedures. This hybrid cement is self-setting
through the reactions of the glass ionomer and acid–base reactions [8]. It has comparable or
higher retentive strengths to those of other types of permanent cements [9,20]. CaAl/GIC
has sufﬁcient working and setting times, thereby allowing a relatively easy mix process and
the removal of excess cement [9,73]. One of the major advantages of this hybrid cement is
its bioactivity to promote remineralization [7]. Moreover, the cement provides a negatively

Dent. J. 2022, 10, 208

7 of 16

charged surface and releases calcium and phosphate ions, thus fulﬁlling the prerequisites
of being bioactive [7]. CaAl/GIC possesses stronger antibacterial properties when it is
compared with self-adhesive resin cement and conventional GIC [74]. The sealing ability
and microleakage pattern are also comparable to that of self-adhesive resin cement [26].
These characteristics are favorable to inhibiting recurrent caries in patients. In addition,
CaAl/GI presents satisfactory postoperative sensitivity, retention, marginal integrity and
color stability [72,73,75,76]. However, long-term clinical evaluations are generally lacking,
and more laboratory studies comparing its properties such as ﬂuoride release, color stability
and mechanical strengths are needed. The indication of CaAl/GIC includes the deﬁnitive
cementation of metal or porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns and bridges, gold inlays and
onlays, cast or prefabricated metal posts, and high-strength ceramic crowns and bridges
such as zirconia, alumina and lithium disilicate.

4.5. Resin Cements

Both the conventional resin cement with a separate adhesive system (or adhesive resin
cement) and the self-adhesive resin cement can be used as luting cements. They have the
advantages of high compressive and tensile strengths, a high bond strength, a low water
solubility and good aesthetic properties, which make them the leading luting cements
today [2]. Proper moisture control is also necessary to achieve a reasonable bond strength
for resin cements [77]. In the cases where isolation cannot be achieved, the use of alternative
cements may be a better option.

4.5.1. Conventional Resin Cement

Conventional resin cement has a similar chemical composition to restorative resin
composites. They consist of resin monomers, such as methyl methacrylate, bisphenol
A-glycidyl methacrylate dimethacrylate (Bis-GMA) and urethane dimethacrylate, which
undergo polymerization during the setting reaction [5]. The ﬁller concentration in the
resin cement is lowered to allow for a thin ﬁlm thickness and a sufﬁcient working time [6].
The bonding mechanism of conventional resin cement to enamel is made through mi-
cromechanical interlocking after acid etching. The removal of the smear layer, surface
demineralization and the application of a primer is needed to achieve the resin bonding in
dentine [5].

Some conventional resin cements require the prior application of adhesive systems.
The adhesive systems of conventional resin cements can be divided into total etch (etch-and-
rinse) and self-etch [78] based on the etching mechanism. The biggest disadvantage of the
total-etch cement is the multistep application that increases the risk of contamination that
compromises the bond strength [79]. There is also a higher risk of postoperative sensitivity
when it is compared to the self-etch systems [80]. Moreover, the total-etch strategy only
beneﬁts the enamel bonding, but not the dentinal bonding [81]. It has been shown that resin
monomers were unable to penetrate into deeper areas of the hybrid layer, resulting in the
incomplete inﬁltration in the dentine [82]. On the other hand, using self-etching adhesives
alone reduces the enamel bonding efﬁcacy because the effect of demineralization is less
than that which occurs with phosphoric acid [83]. Therefore, selective enamel etching with
self-etching adhesives is the suggested strategy to optimize bonding [81].

From the ISO speciﬁcation 4049 (2019), resin cement can be classiﬁed according to
the mode of the cure: class 1 (self-cured), class 2 (light-cured), and class 3 (dual-cured).
Self-cured cement is used for luting thick, opaque restorations and materials that are not
translucent, such as metals and highly opaque ceramics [84]. This is to ensure a high degree
of conversion and optimal properties in the areas where light cannot reach [85]. However,
this type of cement has the limitations of a reduced working time and the tendency to
discolorize due to the high concentration of tertiary amines, which are the polymerization
activators [86]. Therefore, in cases where there is a high aesthetic demand such as laminate
veneers, a light-cured cement is the best material of choice [87,88].

Dent. J. 2022, 10, 208

On the other hand, dual-cured resin cement combines both of the curing modes and
has the gain of an increased versatility in its clinical usage. The system contains a catalyst
paste with a chemical initiator (benzoyl peroxide) and a base paste with the light-cured
resin cement and a tertiary amine [89]. When it is mixed and light-cured, a polymerization
reaction occurs by photo and chemical activation. Although the dual-cured cement appears
to be the safest choice to ensure sufﬁcient polymerization, the degree of the cure without
light activation can be as low as 10.82% [90]. An insufﬁcient light exposure under 4 mm
thick ceramic restorations can result in a degree of cure that is even lower than that of the
self-cure alone [91]. There have also been studies suggesting extending the light curing to
120s to beneﬁt the degree of conversion and achieve better mechanical strengths [92,93].
Therefore, clinicians should choose the appropriate class of resin cement according to the
material and thickness of the restoration to achieve the best outcome. Generally, for ceramic
restorations that are thinner than 2.0 mm, light-cured and dual-cured cement produces a
better result than self-cured cement does [94].

In general, conventional resin cements are widely indicated for cementing aesthetic
all-ceramic and indirect-resin restorations and veneers. The cementation of metal and
metal-ceramic restorations with compromised retention and resistance forms, such as
resin-bonded bridges and short crowns, and post-cementation in root-treated teeth are also
possible indications [2]. Regarding the disadvantages of conventional resin cement, the
cost is high, there is a sensitivity to the technique, it is time-consuming, and it is difﬁcult
to remove the excess cement. Therefore, it is contraindicated in cementing prefabricated
crowns, especially in pediatric patients [51].

4.5.2. Self-Adhesive Resin Cements

Self-adhesive resin cement is a type of resin cement that can adhere to the tooth
structures without a separate adhesive and etchant [95]. The ﬁrst commercial product was
developed in the early 2000s to simplify the clinical steps of the application. The major
constituents of the self-adhesive resin cement include functional acidic monomers (e.g., 10-
methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate), conventional dimethacrylate monomers
(e.g., Bis-GMA), ﬁllers and activator-initiator systems [87]. Similar to self-etching adhesive
systems, the functional acidic monomers create a low pH and high hydrophilicity during
the initial setting reaction. This gives the material the ability to wet and etch the tooth
surface to facilitate a homogenous inﬁltration of the adhesive resin [96]. As the reaction
proceeds, the acidic functional groups react with the calcium in the dental tissues and a
range of metal oxides from ion-leachable inorganic ﬁllers, resulting in a gradually increased
pH and hydrophobicity [97].

Self-adhesive resin cement has the clinical advantage of triggering less postoperative
sensitivity when it is compared to RMGIC and GIC [98,99]. However, the adhesive perfor-
mance and bond strengths to both the enamel and dentine of self-adhesive resin cements
are lower than those of conventional multi-step resin cements [100,101]. Although a 2-year
study showed that self-adhesive resin cement had similar clinical outcomes to those of
the multistep conventional resin cements [102], another 5-year prospective clinical study
reported that total-etch resin cement showed a better performance in terms of marginal
discoloration and adaptation after the recall [103]. When it is compared to conventional
resin cement, the self-adhesive resin cement does not have a separate phosphoric acid
etching property in enamel for the wetting effect and creation of microporosities. They
only rely on the acidic functional monomers for bonding, which are generally weaker
than the conventional etchant is [87]. Moreover, following a tooth preparation by rotary
instruments, the enamel and dentine are covered with an acid-soluble smear layer [104].
Because there is no etch-and-rinse procedure before the application, the smear layer is
not removed. Although self-adhesive resin cements can interact with the smear layer to
reinforce the smear plugs, these structures are micromechanically weaker than the resin
tags are and thus, provide a lower bond strength to the dentine [105].

Self-adhesive resin cements provide an improved ease of application than the conven-
tional resin cements can, and they can be used in cementing a variety of indirect restorations.
However, because the bond strength is lower than that of the conventional resin cement, it
is not recommended to use self-adhesive resin cement to cement restorations with reduced
retention and resistance forms, such as resin-bonded bridges and crowns with insufﬁcient
heights. Moreover, due to weaker enamel bonding and a greater incidence of discoloration,
it is unsuitable to cement veneers as well [87].

5. New Development of Luting Cements
5.1. Modiﬁcations on Currently Available Luting Cements
5.1.1. Modiﬁcations on Glass Ionomer Cement

Nanotechnology has been incorporated into the development of GIC to improve its
mechanical and physical properties [106]. Nano-modiﬁcations of GIC can be achieved
by either reducing the size of the glass particles or the addition of nano-sized ﬁllers
or bioceramics to gain the potential beneﬁts of an increased mechanical strength and
bioactivity [107,108]. Because it was suggested that resizing the glass particles in GIC to
nanoscales does not signiﬁcantly improve the physical properties of the cement [109], the
focus of recent developments has been shifted to the incorporation of nano-sized ﬁllers
or the addition of nano-hydroxyapatite crystals as ﬁllers. Hydroxyapatite is a naturally
occurring form of the mineral calcium apatite (calcium, phosphorus and oxygen) and is one
of the major compositions of bone, enamel and dentine [110]. The research has shown that
GIC that is modiﬁed by nano-hydroxyapatite has an increased mechanical strength [111]
and bond strength to dentine [112]. Moreover, the addition of hydroxyapatite to GIC
powder can increase the crystallinity of the set GIC, thereby improving the chemical stability
and water insolubility of it [112,113]. Studies have also found that nano-hydroxyapatite-
modiﬁed GIC not only has a higher compatibility than conventional GIC does, but also a
greater release of ﬂuoride ions [114,115].

Another modiﬁcation is the addition of calcium sodium phosphosilicate bioactive
glass to GIC. In 1969, Hench introduced the original phosphosilicate bioactive glass as 45S5
Bioglass with a speciﬁc chemical composition and weight percentages of silica dioxide,
calcium oxide, sodium oxide and phosphorus pentoxide [56,116]. Although the addition of
the phosphosilicate bioactive glass to GIC increased the remineralization, the mechanical
strength of the material was found to be compromised [117–119]. In a recent development,
bioactive glass nanoparticles have been used to modify GIC instead of the conventional
micro-sized ones. Bioactive glass nanoparticles carry the advantages of phosphosilicate
bioactive glass, but with increased compressive, tensile and ﬂexural strengths [120]. How-
ever, the long-term effects that they have on the human body are unknown, and further
studies are still needed before their clinical application in dentistry.

5.1.2. Modiﬁcations on Resin Cement

The recent development of resin cement has been made to enhance its anticariogenic
capacity [121]. Despite it being the most widely used luting cements in modern dentistry,
resin cement has no antibacterial effect. It cannot prevent recurrent caries, which is one of
the main reasons for the failure of the restorations [122]. The modiﬁcations of resin cement
include the addition of antimicrobial compounds, such as silver nanoparticles, quaternary
ammonium polyethyleneimine nanoparticles, cetylpyridinium chloride modiﬁed montmo-
rillonite and chlorhexidine diacetate and ursolic acid [123–127]. Efforts have been made to
determine the ideal concentrations of these compounds without adversely affecting the
mechanical properties of the resin, while also retaining their antibacterial abilities [124].

Some novel developments of resin cements have been made to introduce “self-healing”
capacities for the dental resin to resist cracks and fractures. This is achieved by em-
bedding microcapsules with an external shell and healing liquid into the composite
material [128,129]. When cracking occurs in the polymer, the microcapsules rupture and re-
lease the healing liquid into the crack planes. This exposes them to the catalysts in the poly-

Dent. J. 2022, 10, 208

10 of 16

mer matrix, and consequently, the patient undergoes polymerization to ﬁll the crack [129].
A recent development on resin composites using triethylene glycol dimethacrylate-N and
N-dihydroxyethyl-p-toluidine healing liquid in poly(urea-formaldehyde) shells successfully
exhibited a substantial self-healing capability in terms of the virgin fracture toughness [130].
Another direction to modify the resin cement was to enhance the polymerization of the
resin monomers because the mechanical properties and bond strengths of the resin cement
are affected by the polymerization of the resin monomers. Because the acidic functional
monomers inhibit free radical formation by the traditional benzoyl periodize/tertiary amine
initiators, researchers have developed the process of chemically curing the co-initiators to
achieve a more efﬁcient curing [131]. Another approach to enhance the polymerization of
the resin cement is known as “touch curing” or “contact curing” [132]. In this system, a
proprietary non-tertiary amine accelerator is present in the primer, which accelerates the
curing when it is in contact with the cement [133].

5.1.3. Restorative Composite Resin as an Alternative Luting Material

Recently, there have been studies looking into the possibility of using restorative com-
posite resin as an alternative luting material due to it having a lower cost, better strength
properties, lower marginal deterioration, and greater range of shade selections [134]. As a
restorative material, composite resin differs from resin cements by having a higher percent-
age of ﬁller particles, resulting in it having a higher viscosity, greater ﬁlm thickness and
lower ﬂowability [135]. To solve these problems, preheating and ultrasonic vibration tech-
niques were tested to reduce the ﬁlm thickness and viscosity [136]. Both of the techniques
were shown to be effective in reducing the ﬁlm thickness of the material. However, not all
of the tested composite resins after preheating and ultrasonic vibration were able to reach a
ﬁlm thickness of less than 50 µm [134], which is speciﬁed in ISO standard 4049:2019 [137].
When a thin ﬁlm thickness and a high viscosity cannot be achieved, the fracture resistance
of the restoration and marginal adaptation will be drastically jeopardized [138–140]. Hence,
other modiﬁcation techniques should be studied in the future before the composite resin
can be modiﬁed to be a luting agent.

5.2. Development of Novel Luting Materials—Castor Oil Polyurethane Cement

Castor oil polyurethane is a biomaterial with great biocompatibility, and it is easy to
handle. It is extracted from a plant called Ricinus communis, which is abundantly found
in Brazil [141]. Due to its large commercial availability, it is expected to be a prospective
versatile dental material with a reduced cost, and it is highly sustainable. As castor oil
polyurethane has good biocompatibility properties, osteo-inductive properties and antimi-
crobial abilities, it has great potential to be developed as a versatile dental material. Some
studies have tested its use as a luting cement [141–143]. The luting material was presented
as a two-part system with calcium carbonate ﬁllers [142]. Although the ﬂexural strength of
castor oil polyurethane was only 25% of that of adhesive resin cement, it is comparable to
the conventional cements such as zinc phosphate and GIC [143]. Modiﬁcations of castor oil
polyurethane with the addition of different ﬁllers to enhance its mechanical strength could
be the direction of its future development.

6. Summary

Luting material aids in the retention and stability of indirect restorations. The com-
mon luting materials include zinc oxide eugenol and non-eugenol, zinc phosphate, zinc
polycarboxylate, GIC, RMGIC, resin cement and hybrid CaAl/GI. Each of them possesses
unique properties and clinical implications. Because none of the currently available luting
materials can fulﬁl all of the clinical applications, researchers are modifying GIC and resin
cements with various technologies and developing novel luting materials, such as castor
oil polyurethane cements, to meet various clinical requirements.
