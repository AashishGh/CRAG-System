Abstract: The plastic treatment of products reduced to sizes corresponding to the microscale poses
diﬃculties, due to the occurrence of the so-called size eﬀect, which is responsible for the diﬀerent
behavior of the material during the realization of microforming. In this study, a constitutive equation
was elaborated taking into account two types of size eﬀects, with the use of a surface model as well
as a composite material model. The inﬂuence of the size eﬀect referring to both the material grain
size and the geometric scaling of the sample size on the material’s ﬂow stresses was considered.
The surface model took into account the diﬀerent grain shapes present in actual polycrystalline
materials. After the application of the presented model for titanium Grade 2, a good agreement of the
experimental results with the FEM simulation results was obtained. Thus, the proper FEM modeling
of microforming processes should be conducted with the use of a material model, taking into account
the occurring size eﬀects.

1. Introduction

One of the modern plastic treatment technologies is microforming, which makes it possible
to produce metal components with dimensions below 1 mm [1–8]. At this scale, there are various
factors aﬀecting the deformation behavior, process performance, and quality of microformed parts.
Microstructures of a material become increasingly important as the size of the material is reduced to
the microscale. When sheet metal is only a few grains thick, its mechanical properties may diﬀer from
those of the bulk metal with a regular scale. An important issue in the examination of microforming
processes is the so-called size eﬀect. Size eﬀects can be described as deviations from the expected
result, which take place when the size of the examined object changes. They play a signiﬁcant role in
processes involving scaling. Size eﬀects can be helpful in the development of knowledge as well as
in the understanding of the phenomena occurring in micro- and nanotechnology. It was observed
that a change in the geometrical dimensions of the sample also causes a change in its mechanical
properties [8].

Various theories have been developed for the modeling of macroscale plastic deformation
during metal forming. The traditional constitutive model is no longer valid for accurate analysis of
microforming processes. In order to obtain a relation between the material’s plastic deformation and
the size eﬀects, investigations referring to the microforming of copper and aluminum alloys were
performed [9]. The results obtained by the authors showed that the yield stresses decrease with
an increasing miniaturization, with a constant grain size of the material [10]. Miyazaki et al. [11]
investigated the eﬀect of specimen size on the ﬂow stress of a rod specimen of polycrystalline Cu–Al
alloy and an aﬀected zone model was proposed to explain why the ﬂow stress decreases with the
dimensional reduction of the specimen. Kals et al. [12] and Engel et al. [13] proposed a model called
the “surface model”, which is currently applied to analyze the inﬂuence of the size eﬀect on yield

stresses. The model assumes that the sample consists of two separate parts (the internal part and the
surface layer). The percentage share of the surface layer grains increases with an increase in the grain
size or with a decrease in the geometrical dimensions of the object [12,13].

The study presented below uses a model which consists of a surface model [13] and a composite
model of polycrystalline materials [14]. The composite model [14] assumes that grains are spherical
and are composed of grain boundary layers and grain interiors. This model has been proven to be a
valid and eﬀective approach to describe the relationship between the ﬂow stress of the polycrystalline
aggregate and grain size.

The model takes into account the phenomenon of grain boundary hardening of the external grain
surface under the eﬀect of plastic deformations. The yield stresses in the given grain change according
to the “mixture law” [11].

The model proposed in the study takes into consideration two size eﬀects: one connected with the
grain size and the other related to the geometrical dimensions of the sample. Experimental studies were
conducted on cylindrical samples made of pure titanium Grade 2, which were deformed as samples in a
uniaxial compression test. Pure titanium is often used for the manufacture of microparts in biomedical
devices and implants because of its light weight, biocompatibility, and outstanding corrosion resistance.
The obtained experimental results were then analyzed using the proposed model taking into account the
two size eﬀects. The model was then applied in FEM calculations. Next, the experimental results were
compared with the results of numerical simulations. The simulations were helpful in the development
of tools for microforming implants for a total ossicular replacement prosthesis.

2. The Grain Size Eﬀect

For the material taking into account the size eﬀect referring to grain size, the composite material
model by Kocks [15] and Meyers and Ashworth [14] was applied. The test showed that, in the given
grain, the grain boundary zone exhibits better hardening than its interior zone [16]. Meyers and
Ashworth [14] divided the grain into two parts (the grain interior and the grain boundary). This division
has been presented in Figure 1 for a few selected grain shapes: a regular hexagon, a rhomb, and a
symmetric trapezium, assuming that the grain size is d and the thickness of the grain boundary layer
is tz.

Figure 1. Grain interior and grain boundary models.

According to the material composite model, the yield stresses are calculated from the equation

S = σZW fZW + σZZ fZZ

where: σ
S —the ﬂow stresses of the polycrystalline aggregate (MPa), fZW, fZZ —the area fraction of the
interior and boundary grains, and σZW, σZZ —the ﬂow stresses occurring for the interior and boundary
grains (MPa).

The percentage share of the surface layer grains increases with an increase in the grain size or with a decrease in the geometrical dimensions of the object [12,13]. The study presented below uses a model which consists of a surface model [13] and a composite model of polycrystalline materials [14]. The composite model [14] assumes that grains are spherical and are composed of grain boundary layers and grain interiors. This model has been proven to be a valid and effective approach to describe the relationship between the flow stress of the polycrystalline aggregate and grain size. The model takes into account the phenomenon of grain boundary hardening of the external grain surface under the effect of plastic deformations. The yield stresses in the given grain change according to the “mixture law” [11].

The Grain Size Effect For the material taking into account the size effect referring to grain size, the composite material model by Kocks [15] and Meyers and Ashworth [14] was applied. The test showed that, in the given grain, the grain boundary zone exhibits better hardening than its interior zone [16]. Meyers and Ashworth [14] divided the grain into two parts (the grain interior and the grain boundary). This division has been presented in Figure 1 for a few selected grain shapes: a regular hexagon, a rhomb, and a symmetric trapezium, assuming that the grain size is d and the thickness of the grain boundary layer is tz.  Figure 1. Grain interior and grain boundary models. According to the material composite model, the yield stresses are calculated from the equation 𝜎(cid:3020)=𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024)𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3024)+𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3027)𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3027) (1) where: 𝜎(cid:3020) —the flow stresses of the polycrystalline aggregate (MPa), 𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3024),𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3027) —the area fraction of the interior and boundary grains, and 𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024),𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3027) —the flow stresses occurring for the interior and boundary grains (MPa). The area fractions for the grain model with a regular hexagon shape are as follows: 𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3024)=3√32(𝑑2−2𝑡(cid:3027)√3)(cid:2870)3√32(𝑑2)(cid:2870)=1−8 √3𝑡(cid:3027)𝑑+163𝑡(cid:3027)(cid:2870)𝑑(cid:2870) (2) Materials 2020, 13, 5143

The thickness of the boundary grain layer is connected with the grain size in the following

formula [17]:

tZ = k·dn(0 < n < 1)

(8)

where k and n are treated as constants for the given material, which can be obtained from the Hall–Petch
relation, where, for titanium, k = 0.4, and n = 0.5 [10].

After the substitution of Equation (9) into Equation (8), the following relation was obtained:

Similar considerations can be performed for a grain with a rhomb and symmetric trapezium
shape, which can be isolated in titanium Grade 2. It was assumed that in the case of a rhomb, its shorter

diagonal is equal to the diameter of the grain d. It was assumed that the angles in the rhomb equal 65

and 115

Therefore, the yield stress for the polycrystalline aggregate will equal

Similar to the case of a regular hexagon, the following ﬁnal relation was obtained:

grain diameter d and the lower base is twice as long as the upper base. The angels in the assumed

σs = σZW + 14.24·k(σZZ − σZW)dn−1 − 40.96·k2(σZZ − σZW)d2n−2

(17)

3. Geometrical Size Eﬀect

The other analyzed size eﬀect is the geometrical eﬀect. In order to consider this eﬀect, a surface
material model was applied. The aim was to determine the inﬂuence of the geometrical size eﬀect
on the changes in the ﬂow stresses. The surface model divides the analyzed samples into two parts:
the surface layer and the inner section. The yield stress can be calculated from the formula

σ = ησwewn + (1 − η)σpow

(18)

where: σ —the material’s ﬂow stresses (MPa), η —the geometric scale coeﬃcient (–), and σwewn,
σpow —the ﬂow stresses for the inner and the surface grains (MPa).

The grains in the inner portion of the specimen for the surface model consist of the interior and
grain boundary. Therefore, the ﬂow stresses of the inner grains are equal to the ﬂow stress of the
polycrystalline aggregate: σwewn = σs. The grains located at the free surfaces have less hardening
eﬀect than the inner grains. It is assumed that in the surface layer, the phenomenon of external grain
hardening occurs, so the ﬂow stress of the surface layer in the surface model will be equal to the ﬂow
stress of the interior grain of the composite model: σpow = σZW. It was assumed that the thickness
of the surface layer is equal to the thickness of one grain [10]. Figure 2 shows a cross-section of a
cylindrical sample with its marked layers.

Figure 2. Surface layer and inner portions in a specimen section.

The surface model will consist of diﬀerent grain shapes, so the ﬂow stresses for this model will be

represented by the following formula:

where: r—the particular shares of the grains in the structure, and σsi —the given yield stress for the
particular grain shape.

By analyzing the microsection composition of titanium Grade 2, it is possible to determine the
shares of the particular grain shapes in the material. It was assumed that the rhomb-shaped grains
occupy approximately 50%, the trapezium-shaped grains 40%, and the hexagon-shaped grains 10%.
Presented below is an equation which takes into account the particular shares.

In order to lower the parameter η for the cylindrical sample, we use the geometric relation

(21)

Therefore, the elaborated model (21) takes into account the eﬀects connected with the grain size

and the geometrical dimensions of the sample.

4. Determination of the Parameters for a Model Considering Two Size Eﬀects

In the analyzed material model (21), there are two unknowns, which are the ﬂow stresses of the
interior grain σZW and the boundary grain σZZ. We assume that the ﬂow stresses can be presented in
the form of the following linear function [10]:

σ = A + Bη

where:

A = σZW; B = (0.1 × 16√

−(0.1 × 64

(22)

(23)

When there are more than two experimentally determined reinforcement curves with diﬀerent
geometrical scale factors η, it is possible to determine the model parameters (A and B). In order to
determine the form of the linear function (22), parameters A and B from diﬀerent reinforcement curves
were matched in such a way so as to obtain the ﬁnal form of Equation (22). In this way, we can
determine the values for σZW and σZZ.

For such a model, the area fractions of the particular parts of the grain were calculated: 𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3024)=(cid:3117)(cid:3118)((cid:3279)(cid:3343)(cid:3118)(cid:2879)(cid:2870).(cid:2873)(cid:2874)(cid:3047)(cid:3053))((cid:3031)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)(cid:3047)(cid:3053))(cid:3117)(cid:3120)(cid:3031)(cid:3095)∙(cid:3031)  (14)  𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3027)=14𝑑𝜋∙𝑑−12(𝑑𝜋2−2.56𝑡𝑧)(𝑑−2𝑡𝑧)14𝑑𝜋∙𝑑=1−𝑓(cid:3027)(cid:3024)  (15) The yield stress equals 𝜎(cid:3046)=𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024)+7.12∙𝑡𝑧(𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3027)−𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024))𝑑(cid:2879)(cid:2869)−10.24∙𝑡𝑧(cid:2870)(𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3027)−𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024))𝑑(cid:2879)(cid:2870) (16) Ultimately, the following relation for the yield stress of the polycrystalline aggregate was obtained: 𝜎(cid:3046)=𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024)+14.24∙𝑘(𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3027)−𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024))𝑑(cid:3041)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)−40.96∙𝑘(cid:2870)(𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3027)−𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024))𝑑(cid:2870)(cid:3041)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)  (17) 3. Geometrical Size Effect The other analyzed size effect is the geometrical effect. In order to consider this effect, a surface material model was applied. The aim was to determine the influence of the geometrical size effect on the changes in the flow stresses. The surface model divides the analyzed samples into two parts: the surface layer and the inner section. The yield stress can be calculated from the formula 𝜎=𝜂𝜎(cid:3050)(cid:3032)(cid:3050)(cid:3041)+(1−𝜂)𝜎(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3050) (18) where: 𝜎 —the material’s flow stresses (MPa), 𝜂 —the geometric scale coefficient (–), and 𝜎(cid:3050)(cid:3032)(cid:3050)(cid:3041),𝜎(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3050) —the flow stresses for the inner and the surface grains (MPa). The grains in the inner portion of the specimen for the surface model consist of the interior and grain boundary. Therefore, the flow stresses of the inner grains are equal to the flow stress of the polycrystalline aggregate: 𝜎(cid:3050)(cid:3032)(cid:3050)(cid:3041)  =  𝜎(cid:3046). The grains located at the free surfaces have less hardening effect than the inner grains. It is assumed that in the surface layer, the phenomenon of external grain hardening occurs, so the flow stress of the surface layer in the surface model will be equal to the flow stress of the interior grain of the composite model: 𝜎(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3050)  =  𝜎(cid:3027)(cid:3024). It was assumed that the thickness of the surface layer is equal to the thickness of one grain [10]. Figure 2 shows a cross-section of a cylindrical sample with its marked layers.  Figure 2. Surface layer and inner portions in a specimen section. The surface model will consist of different grain shapes, so the flow stresses for this model will be represented by the following formula: Materials 2020, 13, 5143

In order to verify the correctness of the assumed model, an experiential compression test was
performed on cylindrical samples made of titanium Grade 2 with the mean grain size of d = 37 µm.
To guarantee each specimen has a similar deformation, a scaling factor λ is introduced to scale-down
the specimen geometry and process parameters. In the tests, three diﬀerent scale factors λ and η were
applied, which have been compiled with the assumed sample dimensions in Table 1.

6. FEM Simulation

FEM modeling of uniaxial compression tests was performed with the use of the MSC MarcMentat
2016 program. For the FEM calculations, the ﬂow curves determined based on Equation (22) were
applied. An elastic–plastic model with isotropic hardening was used. The model used symmetry in
respect to the axis of the cylindrical sample, and rigid tools were applied. For the creation of the ﬁnal
element grid, the four-node element number 10 was applied and the Coulomb friction model was used
(µ = 0.2) [20].

Figure 5 shows a comparison of the experimental results and the theoretical results obtained based

on the constitutive model presented earlier.

Figure 5. Comparison of the stress–strain curves obtained from the experiment and the simulation.

In the experiment, the grain size is constant, and the dimension of the billet as well as other
conditions is varied according to the similarity principle. The miniaturization resulted in lower ﬂow
stresses. A very good agreement of the experimental results and the FEM simulation results of three
titanium samples made with diﬀerent scale factors λ was obtained. For larger deformations, we can
observe the inﬂuence of the size eﬀect on the obtained yield stress values. The phenomenon of
decreasing ﬂow stress curves occurs. The model can be used to reveal the eﬀect of geometry size on
the deformation of bulk metals.

Figure 5 shows a comparison of the experimental results and the theoretical results obtained based on the constitutive model presented earlier.  Figure 5. Comparison of the stress–strain curves obtained from the experiment and the simulation. In the experiment, the grain size is constant, and the dimension of the billet as well as other conditions is varied according to the similarity principle. The miniaturization resulted in lower flow stresses. A very good agreement of the experimental results and the FEM simulation results of three titanium samples made with different scale factors λ was obtained. For larger deformations, we can observe the influence of the size effect on the obtained yield stress values. The phenomenon of decreasing flow stress curves occurs. The model can be used to reveal the effect of geometry size on the deformation of bulk metals. The material model was also used for a simulation of the backward microextrusion process of titanium Grade 2. The analysis covered the geometrical shape of the product obtained from the simulations with the use of a material model taking into account the size effect and from the experiment performed on the microforming machine (Figure 6).

We can see a good representation of the shape of the workpiece obtained in the FEM model
(Figure 6). The numerical simulations of the microextrusion and micropressing processes were helpful
in the development of tools for microforming a TOPR-type implant, which is shown in Figure 7.

The elaborated material model considering the size eﬀects ensured the proper FEM modeling of

the microformed components of an ossicle implant.

7. Conclusions

The size eﬀect is considered as an important factor in microforming processes. This study applied
a constitutive model taking into account two size eﬀects: one is attributed to the grain size and the
other is related to the geometrical dimensions of the sample. The model consists of a surface model
and a composite material model. Additionally, the surface model considered diﬀerent grain shapes
present in the actual polycrystalline material such as pure titanium Grade 2. Titanium is often used for
the manufacture of microparts in biomedical devices and implants.

Conclusions The size effect is considered as an important factor in microforming processes. This study applied a constitutive model taking into account two size effects: one is attributed to the grain size and the other is related to the geometrical dimensions of the sample.

Additionally, the surface model considered different grain shapes present in the actual polycrystalline material such as pure titanium Grade 2. Titanium is often used for the manufacture of microparts in biomedical devices and implants. The novelty of the work is the use of a few selected grain shapes: a regular hexagon, a rhomb, and a symmetric trapezium. The model parameters (A and B) determined for samples made of titanium Grade 2 were used to describe the hardening curves applied in the FEM simulations performed for the process of uniaxial compression. The results obtained from the experiments and the simulation are similar. The developed material model can be used for the description of a wide range of materials with diversified grain shapes and should be applied during the FEM modeling of microforming processes in order to consider the various size effects occurring during deformation. Examples of such materials are copper and aluminum alloys. They contain selected grain shapes used in the new material model. The developed material model was used with success for a simulation of the backward microextrusion process component of an ossicle implant.
