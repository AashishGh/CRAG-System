ABSTRACT: The lightweight and high-strength functional nano-
composites are important in many practical applications. Natural
biomaterials with excellent mechanical properties provide inspira-
tion for
improving the performance of composite materials.
Previous studies have usually focused on the bionic design of the
material’s microstructure, sometimes overlooking the importance
of the interphase in the nanocomposite system. In this Perspective,
we will focus on the construction and control of the interphase in
conﬁned space and the connection between the interphase and the
macroscopic properties of the materials. We shall survey the
current understanding of the critical size of the interphase and
discuss the general rules of interphase formation. We hope to raise
awareness of
the interphase concept and encourage more
experimental and simulation studies on this subject, with the aim of an optimal design and controllable preparation of polymer
nanocomposite materials.

■ INTRODUCTION

Polymer nanocomposites are deﬁned as composite materials
with one or more nanoﬁllers distributed inside a polymer
matrix. The general idea is to combine the proccessability of
the
the polymers and superior material properties of
nanoﬁllers,
in the hope of producing composite materials
with signiﬁcantly improved macroscopic properties.1,2

One emerging concept from the nanocomposites is the
dramatic increase in the interface formed between the
nanoﬁllers and the polymers when at least one characteristic
size of the ﬁllers is reduced to a nanometer scale. For ﬁllers
with a spherical shape, the interface area increases by a factor
of 106 when the radius is reduced from micrometer to
nanometer.3,4 This dramatic increase in the interface area
ampliﬁes the interaction between nanoﬁllers and polymer
chains, and polymers located near
the interface make a
profound contribution to the macroscopic material properties
of the nanocomposites.5 Here, we broadly deﬁne the polymer
components near the nanoﬁller surface that possess properties
diﬀerent from those of the bulk polymer as the interphase.

Many diﬀerent types of nanoﬁllers can be incorporated into
the polymer matrix. Spherical nanoparticles provide the
simplest system for the nanocomposites, while anisotropic
nanoﬁllers, such as nanorods (carbon nanotubes, cellulose
nanocrystalline) and nanoplates (clay, graphene, and its
derivatives, MXene, etc.), emerge as major players in polymer
nanocomposites. Although the interface area depends on the
the
volume fraction and only the smallest dimension of

nanoﬁllers, anisotropic nanoﬁllers provide another knob to
tune: namely, the length of the nanorods and the shape of the
nanoplates. Nature is a master at utilizing anisotropic
components to build composite structures with superior
properties.6

The literature on polymer nanocomposites is enormous, and
there are excellent reviews and books on this subject.7−12 In
this Perspective, we aim to focus on the interphase in polymer
nanocomposites, which we believe is the basis of under-

surface of nanoparticles due to various interactions, which greatly limit chain motion. The adsorbed chains form many “loop” structures, which
provide eﬀective sites for entanglement with the surrounding polymer chains. The interphase is formed by inﬁltration of the surrounding chain into
the adsorbed chain. The relaxation of polymer chains in the bulk is inﬂuenced by the entanglement transfer of the interphase, which improves the
macroscopic mechanical properties of nanocomposites.

with a short perspective at the end.

■ INTERPHASE DESCRIPTION

Adding a small amount of colloidal nanoparticles into polymer
melts is known to signiﬁcantly improve the mechanical,
electrical, and optical properties, and these properties of such
a hybrid are much better than those of
its constituents
individually. This clearly indicates that the nanocomposite
properties cannot be viewed as a simple average over the
properties of its constituents. The improvement in the material
properties arises from the interphase formed between the
nanoﬁllers and bulk polymers, where the chain dynamics are
diﬀerent from those of the bulk.9 Priestley et al. enabled the
ﬁrst direct visualization of
the interfacial adsorption layer
around the nanoparticles using TEM and investigated a
correlation between the interfacial layers of diﬀerent structures
and their glass transition temperature (Tg).13 However, a
quantitative measurement of the polymer dynamics in the
interphase of a nanocomposite system remains challenging,
due to the dispersity of the nanoﬁller properties.14 Therefore,
here we focus on the chain dynamics near a ﬂat substrate.
Comprehensive understanding of this model system could
provide a simple way to gain insights into the chain dynamics
in the interphase of real nanocomposites.
Chain Dynamics in the Interphase

In nanocomposites, there are multiple interactions between
polymer chains and the surface of nanoﬁllers,
including
long-range, and short-range interac-
chemical, physical,
tions.15−18 The nanoﬁller surface will be covered by a number
of monomers, whose position is ﬁxed by the polymer/
nanoﬁller surface interaction (Figure 1). When the polymer
chains begin to adsorb to the nanoﬁller surface, the chain
accumulation near the surface is still sparse and has an excess
free volume, which accelerates
the
chains.19−21 Napolitano et al. quantiﬁed the eﬀective local
free volume at the interface, on the basis of the decrease in the
dielectric polarization of probe molecules allowed to diﬀuse at
the adsorbed layers.19 They found that the glass transition

the movement of

temperature (Tg) in an ultrathin ﬁlm was inversely propor-
tional to the interfacial free volume. The free volume can
eventually disappear after prolonged annealing. At thermody-
namic equilibrium, polymer chains are already stabilized
against desorption when the enthalpy decrease caused by the
interaction between polymer chains and the substrate is higher
than the entropy decrease caused by the conformational
restriction.22,23 The number of adsorption points of the chains
on the substrate is approximately N1/2 (N is the degree of
polymerization).24,25 The adsorption of chains is irreversible
on the experimental time scale, because desorption of the
whole chain requires a simultaneous desorption of all adsorbed
segments.26,27

The mobility of polymer chains adsorbed on the substrate is
greatly limited, and their coeﬃcient of thermal expansion is
extremely low. Napolitano et al. showed that the dielectric
relaxation strength of the molecular chain of the adsorption
layer was almost zero and the Tg value was very high.28−30
Koga et al. monitored the diﬀusion of the adsorption layer of
polystyrene (PS) by neutron reﬂection and found that there
was no diﬀusion after heat treatment at 443 K for 3 days,
indicating that the movement ability was greatly limited. The
adsorption layer is also called a “dead layer”.31 However, it
should be mentioned that adsorbed layers are not totally
immobile under certain circumstances.32−39 The surface-
bound chains in solution are not irreversibly adsorbed and
can diﬀuse and exchange on the surface even in the limit of
strong adsorption.32 Granick et al. proposed a simple kinetic
model of polymer desorption and adsorption at a planar
surface and conﬁrmed the model prediction by measuring
polystyrene desorption through polyisoprene overlayers.35
They also found that the desorption of PMMA was linear in
an elapsed time of over 6 h with rate on the order of 1%/h in a
PMMA or pure CCl4 solution.36 Moreover, at high enough
the bound
annealing temperatures, exchange kinetics of
polymers can also appear. Jimenez et al. observed almost no
long-term reorganization of the bound poly(2-vinylpyridine)
layer (BL) at 150 °C (∼ Tg,P2VP + 50 °C) but a notable
reduction in the BL thickness at 175 °C.37 In addition, the
bound polymer fraction decreases as a function of annealing

time and decreases more rapidly at higher temperatures and for
lower molecular weights.38 Cangialosi et al. directly observed
the desorption of polymer melts by fast scanning calorimetry
and showed that the adsorbed layers were heated at a constant
rate up to high temperatures where desorption takes place
spontaneously.39

The polymer chains adsorbed on the substrate can form
many “loop” structures, which provide an eﬀective site for
entanglement with the surrounding polymer chains.40−43 As
the surrounding chains penetrate into the loop structure, an
interphase between the adsorption chain and the free chain is
formed, as shown in Figure 1.44,45 The chain A is entangled
with the adsorbed chain to form a “loop” structure, and then
the chain B is entangled with the chain A.46 The interphase
eﬀect can be transmitted internally through the chain
entanglements of the interphase, which aﬀects the relaxation
behavior of polymer chains in the bulk.47 The most typical
example is that the mechanical and thermal properties of

nylon-6 are signiﬁcantly improved by adding a 5% volume ratio
of clay.48
Structure Control of the Interphase

The formation of a stable interphase does not occur
immediately after the polymer chains make contact with the
substrate (Figure 2a). For weakly polar systems, such as PS,
the time scale of adsorption is even more than 10 orders of
magnitude of the segmental relaxation time.49 Durning et al.
monitored the adsorption behavior of PMMA chains on a
quartz substrate using neutron reﬂection and proposed that
their adsorption kinetics was the same as that of small
molecules.50 The thickness of the adsorption layer is a function
of the adsorption time, and the functional form takes the
exponential type

where hads(t) is the thickness of the adsorption layer at time t,
ht=0 is the initial thickness, Δh is the maximum thickness that
the adsorption layer can increase, and τ is the characteristic
adsorption time. Without consideration of the speciﬁcity of
polymer chains, this equation describes well the adsorption
behavior of many conventional polymers, such as PS and
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) chains on metal aluminum
substrates and PS chains on silicon dioxide substrates.28,51

However, the premise for the application of eq 1 is that the
conformation of each polymer chain adsorbed on the substrate
is the same. In general, this is not the case. The chains ﬁrst
adsorbed to the substrate take a more ﬂat conformation and
can be anchored to the substrate through a large number of
contact sites.52 With an increase in adsorbed chains,
the
contact sites available for late-arriving chains will inevitably
decrease, resulting in diﬀerent adsorption conformations of
later risers in comparison to the early risers.46 On the basis of
this mechanism, Ligoure et al. proposed to decompose the
adsorption process of polymer chains on the substrate into two
stages.53 At the beginning of adsorption where the adsorption
sites are abundant, the chains can be easily adsorbed, and the
thickness of the adsorption layer increases linearly with time.
In the second stage, most adsorption sites have been occupied,
which prevents further adsorption. In this case, the chain
adsorption requires a large conformational adjustment, and
even partial desorption of the original adsorption chains. The
adsorption rate slows down obviously, and the adsorption layer
thickness increases logarithmically with time. This model is
veriﬁed in the adsorption process of a substrate in contact with
a dilute polymer solution.26 Koga et al. studied the thickness of
the interphase (hads) and the adsorption layer (hflat) (ﬂattened
layer), which ﬁnally achieved elute equilibrium with the
thermal annealing time of the PS ﬁlm.40 With an increase in
annealing time, both hads and hflat increased rapidly. As the
annealing time was further increased, however, diﬀerences
between hads and hflat became evident. hflat
remained
unchanged, while hads increased slowly.

the substrate.54 Fujii and co-workers

The thickness of the interphase is also closely related to the
molecular weight of the polymer chains (Figure 2b). Durning
et al. studied the interphase of PMMA with thermal annealing
(165 °C > Tg) on quartz substrate by using neutron
reﬂectance.50 The results showed that the ﬁnal thickness of
≈ N 0.5 after long-
the interphase (hads) could be scaled to hads
term thermal annealing, where N is the degree of polymer-
ization. A similar trend was reported by Housmans et al. in PS
on Si substrates, indicating that the polymer chains with N
segments still maintain the reﬂective random walk statistics
near
studied the
adsorption of PS on a Si−H and SiO2 substrate, where the
interaction between polymer chains and the substrate was
considerably weaker than that of PMMA on the quartz
substrate.55 Interestingly, the thickness of the interphase also
showed strong molecular-weight dependence. Napolitano et al.
studied the adsorption kinetics of PS with diﬀerent molecular
weights at diﬀerent temperatures. The results showed that, for
PS with the same molecular weight, increasing the annealing
temperature can accelerate the adsorption rate but
the
maximum adsorption layer thickness (hads) is independent of
the annealing temperature: the thickness only increases with an
increase in molecular weight. The thickness of the interphase is
deﬁned as hads = aRg with a in the range of 0.5−0.8.54

Meanwhile, the conformation of the adsorption chain can
aﬀect the thickness of the interface layer through a topological

interaction between the structures in the adsorption chain (i.e.,
loops) and those in the adjacent unadsorbed chains. This
the adsorption chain con-
emphasizes the importance of
formation to the long-range interfacial eﬀects. According to the
research results reported by Koga et al., the chains in the
tightly bound adsorbed layers mainly adopt
the closely
arranged loop conformation, which possesses high-density
segment−solid contacts to obtain a large enthalpy gain.40,41,56
This observation enables a precise design of the adsorbed
layers. Zuo et al. proposed to adjust the thickness of the
interphases by adjusting the adsorbed conformation of
polymer chains (Figure 2a).57 They incorporated p-hydrox-
ystyrene (HS) randomly into the polystyrene chains, where HS
formed strong hydrogen bonds with the silica and essentially
anchored to the substrate, while the styrene segment extended
outward to form a loop conformation. By adjustment of the
content of HS in the random copolymer, the extension of the
adsorption chain loops can be adjusted. The adsorbed chains
with larger loops can be easily topologically tangled with
neighboring free chains to form molecular motion coupling,
improving the interphase thickness.
Propagation Distance of the Interphases

As was mentioned above, the adsorbed chains can form long-
range interactions through the chain entanglements in the
interphase, which aﬀect the chain relaxation behavior of the
polymer bulks. Therefore, it is of great practical signiﬁcance to
interfaces with diﬀerent

Up to now, most of the literature has reported that the

in the region of a gradual transition from the
interphase to the bulk, the motion ability of polymer chains is
not static but is a gradient distribution, which is important for

■ INTERPHASE IN NANOCOMPOSITES

Macroscopic properties are optimized when the size of the
interphase matches the averaged separation between the
nanoﬁllers. According to the above content, it can be found
that the interphase has a certain propagation distance, and its
eﬀect on the chain movement presents a gradient distribution.
This size eﬀect of the interphase also exists in nanocomposites,
which controls the macroscopic properties of nanocomposites.

The size eﬀect of the interphase in nanocomposites can be
studied by adjusting the common parameter, which is the
relative amount of polymers and ﬁllers. In nanocomposites
with spherical nanoparticles
randomly dispersed in the
polymer melt, the separation distance (d)65 between particles
can be calculated from the random distribution of the spheres

contributions of the polymer matrix and the nanoparticle
network.67 Sokolov et al. suggested that the strong enhance-
ment in the mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites
was caused by the superposition of chain packing and
stretching in the interphase and polymer bridging.66

Senses et al. used X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to
investigate the nanoscale motion of nanoparticles in poly-
(ethylene oxide) melts with the change in the nanoparticle
fraction (interparticle separation distance) and established a
relationship between the nanoparticle relaxation behavior and
the mechanical properties of the melt (Figure 3c).72 At ϕ

25%, which was at the limit of d/2Rg
relaxation becomes extremely slow and exhibits hyperdiﬀusive
behavior. The relaxation time of nanoparticle motion increased
by orders of magnitude, and the mechanical property of the
nanocomposite was signiﬁcantly reinforced, due to the fact that
polymer chains were bridged with nanoparticles to form a
network. As ϕ
NP = 42% (d/2Rg < 1), the nanoparticle motion
was not further slowed down, while the storage modulus (G′)
increased by 3 orders of magnitude. The reason is that all
polymer chains are practically in direct contact with the
particle surface in the case of such a high ϕ
NP value, and the
particles experience the same viscoelastic environment. Starr et
al. used a molecular simulation to study the eﬀect of the
interparticle separation distance on the chain segment
relaxation and Tg value of polymer nanocomposites (Figure
3b).73 Clearly, several
related length scales need to be
considered: namely, the interparticle separation, d, and the
thickness of
the interphase, h. When the interphases on
adjacent nanoparticles overlap (d/h ≤ 1), the interphase eﬀect
is most signiﬁcant. At d/Rg < 1, the interphase also plays an

important role through the chain bridging eﬀect. In contrarst,
at d/2Rg < 1, the bridging eﬀect is not evident in relatively
short chains.

The inﬂuence of the interphase eﬀect on the Tg value in
diﬀerent regimes of composites is systematically counted in
Figure 3b.14,74−78 In the d/2Rg > 1 regime, there is no dynamic
coupling between polymer chains in the interphase and the
polymer matrix, resulting in extremely little Tg change. In the
d/2Rg < 1 regime, the bridging eﬀect of the interphase restricts
the chain segment motion, leading to a slight increase in the Tg
value. In the d/h < 1 regime, the nanoparticle concentration is
high enough to overlap the adjacent interphases, where Tg
reaches the largest value in this state.

In addition, when the NPs with their tightly bound polymer
layers begin to overlap, the system dynamics lose any obvious
connections to those of the polymer chains that bridge the
nanoparticles. System dynamics are gel-like in this regime, but
the temperature dependence of the system relaxation still
follows the Williams−Landel−Ferry (WLF) relation reminis-
cent of the polymer chains. The storage modulus in the
intermediate-frequency region exhibits a power law response
with the approximate scaling G′ ≈ ω0.2, practically independent
of the polymer molar mass. This behavior turns into a particle-
dominated Arrhenius-like dependence at even higher loadings:
that is, where the d value is comparable to the Kuhn length of
the chains.79

The size eﬀect of the interphase also exists in layered
nanocomposites. The typical example is the nacre’s brick and

mechanical properties.81−84 Among them, the brick refers to
a calcium carbonate plate with a thickness of about 200−900
nm and a lateral thickness of 5−8 μm formed by the orderly
arrangement of calcium carbonate nanocrystals, and the mortar
with a thickness of about 10−50 nm refers to a blend with
ﬂexible proteins and polysaccharides. The layer spacing of
calcium carbonate nanosheets in nacre is narrow enough to
enable the interphase to form bridging eﬀects with the natural
polymer, which can greatly improve the strength and
toughness of the composites. Zhao et al. used the shear ﬂow
generated by the reaction solution in the process of
superspreading to realize a highly oriented arrangement of
nanosheets and synchronously realized rapid in situ ﬁxation of
an oriented structure through rapid cross-linking, which can
prepare layered nanocomposite ﬁlms (Figure 4).85 The
nanocomposite ﬁlms showed ultrahigh mechanical properties
with a tensile strength of 1215 ± 80 MPa and a Young’s
modulus of 198.8 ± 6.5 GPa, as shown in Figure 4b. In order
to reveal the intrinsic mechanical strengthening mechanism,
the eﬀect of

the strength and
modulus of the ﬁlms had a nonmonotonic dependence on
the ﬁlling amount, increasing with the ﬁlling amount up to
25.2% followed by a drop at higher ﬁlling amounts. The reason
is that
interlayer polymer chain
segments becomes more signiﬁcant with the gradual reduction
of nanosheet spacing. When the nanosheet spacing was
reduced to the near state of about 2.6 nm,

The nonmonotonic dependence of the mechanical proper-
ties on the nanoﬁller
fraction is unique for anisotropic
nanoﬁllers. The maximum point might be correlated to the
structural transition from a discontinuous to a continuous
interphase.86 This was suggested by Brinson et al., who
investigated graphene/PMMA composites and found that the
glass transition temperature remained constant after
the
graphene weight ratio exceeded 5%. Similar experimental
evidence can also be found in PVA/MMT composites. Kotov
et al. prepared PVA/MMT composites by means of a layer by
layer assembly.87,88 By adjustment of the volume percentage of
the nanosheets, when the volume percentage was 16%, the
strength of the composite reached its maximum value. As the
nanosheet content was further increased, the overall strength
tended to decrease. For anisotropic nanoﬁllers, it is important

contribution to the material properties. The spatial orientation

integrity under large
deformations through entanglement interactions between the
particles.90 The situation is quite diﬀerent for the glassy state.
In this case, the best mechanical response is obtained when the
NPs are well dispersed and where there is good entanglement
between the grafted polymer chains and the background
polymer matrix.91 The results for the melt state are in accord
with the idea that the preferred structure of the interphase
(including the nanoﬁllers) is continuous. However, which type
of structure can realize the optimal mechanical properties
remains an open question. Here we identify a few strategies to
design nanoﬁller structures with superior material properties,
with an emphasis on the inspiration from material properties,
with inspiration from nature and the anisotropic nanoﬁllers
the nanoﬁller
(Figure 5). Hopefully an understanding of
arrangement could provide some hints as to the optimal
interphase structure.

that retained their mechanical

From a simpliﬁed view, one might expect that the uniform
dispersion of the nanoﬁllers would lead to the optimization of
the material properties, but in general this is not the case for
anisotropic nanoﬁllers. For nanorods and nanoplates, both
their spatial arrangement and orientation order need to be
precisely controlled.
In many scenarios, a hierarchically
organized structure of the nanoﬁllers is often required for
the optimal material properties.
Alignment

For nanocomposites composed of nanorods or nanoplates, it is
well accepted that good alignment of the nanoﬁllers is the
prerequisite to achieve excellent mechanical properties. Natural
tooth enamels consist of short parallel ceramic rods organized
in layers with soft proteins ﬁlling the gap (Figure 5a). Inspired
by this structure, enamel-mimic columnar nanocomposites
with superior material properties was constructed, including
high stiﬀness, good damping, and light weight.92 The
interphase between the stiﬀ nanorods and the soft polymer
matrix contributes to this unusual combination of properties. It
is interesting to note that tooth enamel prefers short nanorods,
so that
the continuous polymer phase has comparable
periodicities in direction along the nanorods and the direction
parallel to the nanorods.

Mother of pearl/nacre is another example of utilizing the
alignment of nanoﬁllers to realize outstanding mechanical
properties (Figure 5a). In nacre, nanoplates of CaCO3 and
biopolymers form a brick and mortar structure. The literature
on nacre-mimic nanocomposites is rich, and this subject has
been reviewed by several authors.7,81 The general consensus is
that better mechanical properties require a high degree of
alignment and eﬃcient stress transfer in the interphase region.
Similarly to previous case of tooth enamel, a small aspect ratio
of the nanoplates results in more ductile materials without too
much sacriﬁce of the stiﬀness.93
Twisting
For anisotropic nanoﬁllers, long-range orientation ordering is
diﬃcult to achieve. Arapaima gigas scales provide an alternative
idea for the spatial organization of nanorods.94 The twisted
plywood structure is composed of many layers of nanorods:
the nanorods in the same layer are parallel-aligned, but the
alignment directions in adjacent layers deviate by a small angle
(Figure 5a). Chen et al. utilized brush-coating to produce
scale-mimic plywood nanocomposites. They found nano-
composites with a small deviation angle (10 or 20°) exhibited
outstanding fracture toughness and crack resistance, which can
be contributed to the high-energy dissipation of the twisted
crack propagation.

A similar strategy also applies to the plate composite. The
inspiration comes from conch shells, whose cross-lamellar
structure enables a 10 times improvement in toughness over
nacre.8 Using additive manufacturing, Gu et al. produced a
three-layer macroscopic composite with an alternating
orientation (Figure 5a). The mechanical tests showed that
adding the second level of a cross-lamellar layer could improve
the impact performance by 85% with respect to the stiﬀ
constituent. The layered structure with a diﬀerent plate
orientation is responsible for the impact resistance of conch-
shell-mimic materials, due to the waving pathways of crack
propagation.
Combination
Previous examples utilized only one type of nanoﬁller. It might
be interesting to use a combination of diﬀerent types of
nanoﬁllers, as diﬀerent nanoﬁllers could work in synergy to
improve the material properties. Prasad et al. attempted binary
combinations of nanodiamond, few-layer graphene, and single-
walled nanotubes to reinforce PVA melts. As demonstrated by
a nanoidentation measurement, nanocomposites with two
types of nanoﬁllers show improvement in the stiﬀness and
hardness in comparison to nanocomposites of single type of
nanoﬁller.95 Using a combination of diﬀerent nanoﬁllers might
open up new ways of designing advanced materials (Figure

5b).■ PERSPECTIVE AND CONCLUSION

From a previous discussion, we have argued that a continuous
interphase might be an ideal structure for the mechanical
enforcement of nanocomposite materials. For any realistic
nanocomposite materials, it is often required that not only the
mechanical properties but also some other macroscopic
properties need to be optimized for speciﬁc applications. For
example,
to create nanocomposite materials, both the
mechanical properties and the conductivity should be
optimized. The requirement of multifunction (besides the
mechanical properties) often creates a strict burden on the
nanoﬁllers, because quite often the nanoﬁllers are tasked to

Perspective

provide both the mechanical reinforcement and other material
properties such as the conductivity.

For macroscale composites, where the bulk contributions
from diﬀerent components dominate while the interface eﬀect
is small, there are suggestions for cross-property optimization.
For example, if a binary mixture of components A and B is
used, component A provides one property (say mechanical
strength) and component B contributes to another property
(say mechanical toughness). Torquato et al. suggested that, in
order
the
to simultaneously optimize both properties of
composite, the two components should both be simultaneously
continuous.96 Although this proposal
is for a macroscale
composite and neglects the interphase,
it suggests that the
creation of multifunctional composites requires exquisite
control over the spatial distribution of the nanoﬁllers. Through
the introduction of the continuous interphase concept, we
hope to provide a paradigm shift of the nanocomposite design:
now the burden of mechanical enforcement (strength and
toughness) is placed on the continuous interphase (and the
polymer phase), while the nanoﬁllers can be chosen to
optimize other macroscopic properties.

In addition, on the basis of

improving the mechanical
properties of nanocomposites by adjusting the interphase
structure, how to fabricate nanocomposites continuously on a
large scale is also a problem that should be considered and
solved for practical applications. Several empirical strategies
have been developed, such as layer by layer,97,98 casting,99,100
vacuum ﬁltration,101−103 and use of magnetic ﬁelds.104,105
However, some defects of these methods limit their practical
application. On the one hand,
it is impossible to fabricate
composites with long-range orientation in a large-scale
production. On the other hand,
for a multicomponent
nanomaterial system, the agglomeration of nanoﬁllers in the
preparation process cannot be avoided. Recently, Zhao et al.
have presented a method of continuous large-scale preparation
based on the superspreading shear-ﬂow-induced alignment of
nanosheets at an immiscible hydrogel/oil
interface, which
applies to the fabrication of layered nanocomposite ﬁlms from
a wide range of polymers and 2D nanoﬁllers.85 We foresee that
the new generation of nanocomposites with high mechanical
properties by adjustment of
the interphase structure will
further expand and provide more innovative applications.
