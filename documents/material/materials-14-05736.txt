Abstract: Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) is becoming a widely used piezoelectric material because
of its ﬂexibility, low cost, light weight, and biocompatibility. Its electronic properties, such as its
permittivity, can be affected by material crystal structure variations, which also greatly impact the
material’s application. It is known that external stress and electrical ﬁelds can alter the crystal
structure of piezoelectric material. In this research, we aim to investigate the relationship between
the external electrical ﬁeld and the permittivity property of PVDF material. The basic standard
equations, ﬁnite element analysis, and experimental measurement are included in this paper. By using
sweeping voltages from −25 V to +25 V using an Agilent Technologies B1500A Semiconductor Device
Analyzer, an increase in the permittivity of the PVDF material is observed. In this work, the study
of the permittivity change under the application of different electrical ﬁelds at room temperature
is presented, and the application of the electrical ﬁeld under different temperatures is also studied
and presented.

1. Introduction

The piezoelectric effect was ﬁrst discovered by Pierre Curie and Jacques in the 1880s [1].
This effect describes the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice
versa [2,3]. Piezoelectric materials are available in natural form and can also be artiﬁcially
synthesized. Quartz, Rochelle salt, and tourmaline are examples of natural piezoelectric
materials. Some piezoelectric materials, such as Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT), Lead
Lanthanum Zirconate Titanate (PLZT), Aluminum Nitride (ALN), Zinc Oxide (ZnO),
and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) are artiﬁcially synthesized [3,4]. The piezoelectric
property is related to the material’s non-centrosymmetric crystal structure [5]. Polarization
happens when an external force is applied to the material and the electrical potential is
exhibited within the material at the same time [6].

In addition to the external force case, the electrical ﬁeld can also affect the crystal
structure of the piezoelectric material, which also leads to a change in permittivity [3].
An increase in the value of the permittivity of PZT-5H was reported following the applica-
tion of an AC bias [7]. This is critical for applications of piezoelectrical material because the
inﬂuence of dielectric constant variations on the piezoelectric material is not neglectable.
No matter whether the material is used as a sensor or as an actuator, the performance of
the piezoelectric material changes if an external electrical ﬁeld can change the material’s
properties. However, if the dielectric constant of the material can be controlled precisely,
the unstable performance problem can be solved.

PVDF is a commonly used piezoelectric material because of its good ﬂexibility, light
weight, low cost, and biocompatibility, and it has the potential to be used in many biomedi-
cal applications [8–10]. For example, PVDF, a ﬂexible piezoelectric material can be used to
measure cardiorespiratory signals [11–13]. PVDF cable sensors are commercially available
to detect thorax displacement by respiratory and ballistic movement by heartbeat [14,15].

The cable is a capacitor made of a long single PVDF ﬁlm, outer conductive braid shield,
and inner copper center core. A charge is generated between the center core and the outer
braid shield when the cable is stretched or compressed by the movement [16]. However,
this charge is usually very small and can be easily affected. Even small capacitance vari-
ations can affect the measurement result. When the temperature changes or an external
electrical ﬁeld is applied to the material, the permittivity will change, which results in a
capacitance change. This change will lead to an unexpected charge change that may affect
the measurement results. Since these kinds of biomedical devices usually work at body
temperature or room temperature, which do not change a lot, this work mainly focuses on
the effect of the electrical ﬁeld on the permittivity of PVDF. The permittivity of PVDF can
be changed by mixing it with BaTiO3 [17]. In this work, we consider the characterization
of the permittivity of PVDF under the inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld. We study the
piezoelectric property and the permittivity of the PVDF material. By using a COMSOL
simulation and experiment measurements, we measure the capacitance versus the applied
voltage and calculate the permittivity change under the application of an electrical ﬁeld at
room temperature and different temperatures.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Basic Standard Equations for Piezoelectric Materials

Strain–Charge and Stress–Charge equations are usually used to express the piezoelec-
tric effect. Most material data show the Strain–Charge form instead of the Stress–Charge
form. However, data in Strain–Charge form can be transformed into Stress–Charge form
for the variation formulation used by the COMSOL simulator for discretization and com-
putation [18]. In this paper, we only show the Strain–Charge form equations to explain the
piezoelectric effect.

2.1.1. Strain-Charge Form

Equations (1) and (2) express the piezoelectric effect in the Strain–Charge form.

D = dT + εE

S = sET + dT E

(1)

(2)

where S, D, T, and E are the strain, electric displacement, external mechanical stress,
and electric ﬁeld in Equation (1), respectively. The material parameters sE, ε, and d are
material compliance, permittivity, and piezoelectric coefﬁcients, respectively [12]. From
these two equations, we know that when no external stress is applied to a piezoelectric
material, the strain mainly depends on the external electrical ﬁeld. To illustrate the di-
rections of the piezoelectric effect, matrix forms of Equations (1) and (2) are expressed as
Equations (3) and (4).

respectively. Subscripts 4, 5, and 6 show the shear directions of the X, Y, and Z axes, respec-
tively.

2.1.2. Permittivity Calculation

Consider a rectangular PVDF sheet with surface area A and thickness Th, as shown in
Figure 1. When applying an electrical ﬁeld with the same direction as the polling direction
of the piezoelectric material, the thickness increases and the area decreases. On the other
hand, when applying an electrical ﬁeld with the opposite direction to the polling direction
of the piezoelectrical material, the thickness decreases while the area increases [19].

no electrical ﬁeld. (b) PVDF sheet under an electrical ﬁeld with the opposite direction to the polling
direction (c) PVDF sheet under electrical ﬁeld with the same direction as the polling direction.

Permittivity, which is also called the dielectric constant, refers to the ability of a
material to store electrical energy under the inﬂuence of an electrical ﬁeld. Figure 2 shows a
capacitor with double-sided metal contacts used to apply an electrical ﬁeld and a dielectric
material between the metal contacts.

Figure 2. Illustration of a capacitor used for the measurement of permittivity.

Permittivity can be determined from the measurement of capacitance, area, and thick-

ness under an electric ﬁeld, according to Equation (5).

C = εA/Th

(5)

C, ε, A, and Th are the capacitance, permittivity, surface area, and thickness, respectively.
ε = εr × ε0, where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and εr is the relative permittivity or di-
electric constant of the material. Due to the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure effect,
the applied electric ﬁeld will change the thickness and surface area as well as the permittiv-
ity of the PVDF sheet.

Inc., a TE Connectivity Company [20]. The material used was a metalized PVDF ﬁlm sheet
with electrodes on both sides with part number 1-1004347-0. The surface area of the
overlapping electrodes was 0.02413 m2 while the thickness was 28 um, according to the
datasheet. Since we were interested in the permittivity change under an electrical ﬁeld

rather than the permittivity under no electrical ﬁeld, the small difference between the real
value and value on the datasheet would not affect the results.

datasheet. d32 was 1.476 pC/N, as determined with COMSOL.

2.3. Simulation in COMSOL 5.6

To calculate the permittivity, the values of thickness, area, and capacitance were
needed. However, the thickness change under the electrical ﬁeld could not be directly
measured because the material was too thin. Thus, a ﬁrst simple estimation of the variation
in the thickness was done by multiplying the d33 parameter by the electrical ﬁeld and
further multiplying it by the thickness of the PVDF sheet. The applied voltage was divided
by the thickness of the material into electrical ﬁelds between the top and bottom surfaces
of the PVDF sheet. The calculation shows that the estimated thickness change was about
0.8 nm, a small and negligible amount for the capacitance analysis when applying 25 V.
To verify the estimation, a COMSOL 5.6 simulation was used to determine the change
in thickness under the applied electrical voltage. The advantage of COMSOL is the ease
of setting up a multi-physics simulation. As it uses one pre-processor, solver, and post-
processor, simulation analysts do not have to use a wide range of tools. In this work,
we used piezoelectric effect Multiphysics in the COMSOL simulator, which includes Solid
Mechanic Physics and Electrostatic Physics. The dimensions of the model assigned in
the simulation were the same as what we used in the experiment. The area of the PVDF
sheet was 0.02413 m2, while the thickness was 28 um. Under different applied voltages,
the changes in the area and thickness were different. For example, if 25 V was applied to the
material (the range for the Agilent Technologies B1500A Semiconductor Device used in the
laboratory), a thickness change of 0.6 nm occurred, as illustrated in Figure 3. This calculated
result was close to the simulation result. However, when compared to the thickness under
a zero electrical ﬁeld, this small thickness variation is negligible. In addition, since the
PVDF sheet was embedded with metalized electrodes on both sides, the surface area of
the metalized electrodes did not change. This implies that the variation in thickness and
surface area for this material can be neglected for this speciﬁc PVDF material packaging.
Thus, the capacitance change of the capacitor only depended on the permittivity change.

2.4. Experimental Measurement

The PVDF sheet used in the experiment had the same dimensions as in the simulation.
The Agilent Technologies B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer was used to obtain the
C-V curve of the piezoelectric PVDF in this work. The measurement settings used for
this machine are shown in Figure 4. The maximum DC output voltage this machine can
generate is 25 V and the minimum voltage is −25 V, so the start and stop DC voltages were
−25 V and 25 V while the voltage increase step was 500 mV. To measure the capacitance,
a 30 mV AC voltage with a frequency of 1 kHz was used. The C-V curve was recorded while
sweeping DC voltages from −25 V to +25 V. The same measurement settings were used to
measure the capacitance change under different DC voltages at different temperatures of
25, 40, 50, 60, and 70 ◦C.

3. Results

The results include the capacitance of the VS applied voltage and permittivity of
the VS electrical ﬁeld. The capacitance of the VS applied voltage was obtained with the
Agilent Semiconductor Device Analyzer. The thickness and surface area were constant.
The variation in capacitance was due to variations in permittivity. According to Equation (5),
the value of permittivity as the capacitance changes can be calculated.

Materials 2021, 14, 5736 5 of 10   compared to the thickness under a zero electrical field, this small thickness variation is negligible.

The C-V curve obtained from the B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer at room
temperature (25 ◦C) is shown in Figure 5. The applied voltage ranged from −25 V to +25 V.
When the voltage increased, the measured capacitance of the PVDF sheet increased.

Figure 5. Measured C-V curve when applying voltages ranging from −25 V to +25 V at room
temperature (25 ◦C).

The permittivity of this PVDF sheet was determined based on ε = C × Th/A. The ap-
plied voltage divided by the thickness was used to determine the electrical ﬁeld based on
E = Applied voltage/Th. The area and thickness were unchangeable in the equations when
different voltages were applied. Thus, as shown in Figure 5, the electrical ﬁeld could be
used to replace voltage/Th. Thus, the permittivity was taken as C × Th/A. Figure 6 plots
the permittivity vs. the electrical ﬁeld with linear ﬁtting. From this ﬁgure, we can see that
the permittivity of the PVDF sheet increased from 9.6867 × 10−11 to 9.6961 × 10−11 F/m
as the electrical ﬁeld increased from −0.89 × 106 to 0.89 × 106 V/m.

We also measured the capacitance change under bias voltages at different tempera-
tures. The PVDF sheet was placed on a temperature controllable plot. At the same time,
we used the Agilent Technologies B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer to measure the
capacitance under bias voltages from −25 V to 25 V at different temperatures. Capacitance
vs. Bias Voltage at different temperatures is shown in Figure 7. The capacitance increased
not only when temperature increased, but also as the bias voltage increased. At room
temperature (25 ◦C), the permittivity with zero electrical ﬁeld was 9.6909 × 10−11 (F/m),
and it ranged from 9.6867 × 10−11 to 9.6961 × 10−11 F/m under bias voltages from −25 V
to 25 V. At 40 ◦C, the permittivity with zero electrical ﬁeld was 9.9793 × 10−11 (F/m), and it
ranged from 9.977 × 10−11 to 9.9886 × 10−11 F/m under bias voltages from −25 V to 25 V.
At 50 ◦C, the permittivity at zero electrical ﬁeld is 10.048 × 10−11 (F/m) and it ranges
from 10.038 × 10−11 F/m to 10.051 × 10−11 F/m under the bias voltage from −25 V to
25 V. At 60 ◦C, the permittivity with zero electrical ﬁeld was 10.135 × 10−11 (F/m), and it
ranged from 10.127 × 10−11 to 10.142 × 10−11 F/m under bias voltages from −25 V to 25 V.
At 70 ◦C, the permittivity with zero electrical ﬁeld was 10.197 × 10−11 (F/m), and it ranged
from 10.19 × 10−11 to 10.211 × 10−11 F/m under bias voltages from −25 V to 25 V.

The capacitance of the VS applied voltage was obtained with the Agilent Semiconductor Device Analyzer. The thickness and surface area were constant. The variation in capacitance was due to variations in permittivity. According to equation 5, the value of permittivity as the capacitance changes can be calculated.  The C-V curve obtained from the B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer at room temperature (25 ℃(cid:4667) is shown in Figure 5. The applied voltage ranged from −25 V to +25 V. When the voltage increased, the measured capacitance of the PVDF sheet increased.   Figure 5. Measured C-V curve when applying voltages ranging from −25 V to +25 V at room temperature (25 ℃(cid:4667). The permittivity of this PVDF sheet was determined based on 𝜀 = C × Th/A. The applied voltage divided by the thickness was used to determine the electrical field based on E = Applied voltage/Th. The area and thickness were unchangeable in the equations when different voltages were applied. Thus, as shown in Figure 5, the electrical field could be used to replace voltage/Th. Thus, the permittivity was taken as C × Th/A. Figure 6 plots the permittivity vs. the electrical field with linear fitting. From this figure, we can see that the permittivity of the PVDF sheet increased from 9.6867 × 10−11 to 9.6961 × 10−11 F/m as the electrical field increased from −0.89 × 106 to 0.89 × 106 V/m.  Materials 2021, 14, 5736

At 50 ℃, the permittivity at zero electrical field is 10.048 × 10−11 (F/m) and it ranges from 10.038 × 10−11 F/m to 10.051 × 10−11 F/m under the bias voltage from −25 V to 25 V.

From the above data, we conclude that the electrical ﬁeld can cause increases in the
permittivity change at high temperatures. However, since most PVDF-based biomedical
devices work at body temperature or room temperature, it is more important to know the
permittivity change under an electrical ﬁeld at a ﬁxed temperature. All measurements
were repeated under the same applied conditions, and the same results were obtained.

4. Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to measure the permittivity of PVDF
under the inﬂuence of an electrical ﬁeld. By sweeping the voltage from negative to positive
values, the capacitance change was observed through measurement with a Semiconductor
Device Analyzer. The thickness change was obtained by COMSOL simulation, although the
change was negligible. The area did not change due to the presence of metalized electrodes
on both sides. Thus, the value of permittivity could be calculated from these results using
the equation ε = C × Th/A. This proposed method for calculating permittivity does not
require high resolution displacement measurement instruments, since the variations in
geometric dimensions were obtained from simulation and the simulation proved that the
thickness change is ignorable. In addition, the metalized electrodes on both sides kept
the capacitor area nearly unchangeable. For the material sample used here, there were
very small variations in the thickness and area of the sample. However, we obtained
large variations in the permittivity of the material in the range from 9.6867 × 10−11 to
9.6961 × 10−11 F/m. In addition, we measured the permittivity change by applying an
electrical ﬁeld at different temperatures. The results show that at high temperatures,
the electrical ﬁeld caused more variation in permittivity. However, most PVDF-based
biomedical devices are wearable at room temperature or implanted at body temperature,
which does not change a lot. Thus, the permittivity change under an electrical ﬁeld is more
important. Further studies will investigate changes in piezoelectric coefﬁcients of PVDF
and other materials under different electrical ﬁelds and temperatures.
