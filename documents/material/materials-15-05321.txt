Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) woven composites have attracted much attention in the lightweight
research of protective armor due to their high speciﬁc strength and good impact resistance. However,
there are still many gaps in terms of the performance and inﬂuencing factors of three-dimensional
deep-angle-interlock (3DDAI) Kevlar/EP armor materials. Therefore, in order to prepare 3DDAI
Kevlar/EP armor materials with excellent ballistic resistance and mechanical properties, this paper
studies the bending performance of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials and the inﬂuence of the
number of stacking layers, resin content, laying method, and weft density. Finally, we compare it
with the traditional two-dimensional (2D) plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material. The results
showed that when the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material was subjected to bending load, the upper
and bottom layers of the material had a great inﬂuence on the initial stiffness and fracture strength
of the material, respectively; when the material’s warp and weft density are quite different, the
utilization rate of the yarn and the strength of the material are negatively affected; the fracture energy
of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material prepared by the orthogonal laying method was about 20%
higher than that of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material with the unidirectional layering method;
and the bending performance of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material in the weft direction was
better than that of the 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material, with the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP
armor material having better delamination resistance. The research results will lay the foundation for
structural optimization and engineering applications of such materials.

ing layers

1. Introduction

Fiber-reinforced composite materials are widely used in aerospace, transportation,
military protection, and other ﬁelds due to their low density and high strength [1–3]. In
the ﬁeld of protection, ﬁber-reinforced composite materials can be directly prepared into
armor for protection and can also be used as a back plate to form composite armor with a
ceramic/metal panel [4,5].

Three-dimensional (3D) woven composite materials outperform the traditional two-
dimensional (2D) fabrics laminated to prepare laminate armor [5], in terms of impact
resistance and interlayer shear resistance [6–9]. Due to the designability and structural
complexity of 3D woven composites, previous studies have mainly focused on fabric
structure, hybrid effects, and failure mechanisms. Warren et al. [10] combined a digital
image method to study the tensile, compression, and in-plane shear performance of 3D
orthogonal, shallow bend-interlock composite materials and compared them with 2D
woven composites. Dai et al. [11] studied the tensile, compression, and bending properties
of four 3D orthogonal and two 3D deep-angle-interlock composite materials, and found
that the initial damage positions of the six composite materials with different structures

were all at the interweaving point of the resin-rich zone. Zhang et al. [12] used immersion-
focused ultrasound imaging and micro-computed tomography technology to study the
bending properties and damage mechanism of 3D shallow bend-interlock carbon/epoxy
composites along different angles (0◦, 30◦, 45◦, 90◦). The study found that the material
has higher ﬂexural strength, initial modulus, and lower bending deformation along the
axis (0◦, 90◦) than the off-axis (30◦, 45◦). The on-axis sample exhibits quasi-brittleness,
and the off-axis style exhibits better elongation properties and effectively reduces cracks
and delamination. Fan et al. [13] prepared 3D orthogonal C-G/epoxy hybrid composites,
with glass ﬁbers in the upper and bottom layers and carbon ﬁbers in the middle layer,
and Z-binder yarns to study their bending properties and bending fatigue properties and
compared them with the 3D orthogonal carbon ﬁber/epoxy composites and the laminated
C-G/epoxy hybrid composites. The study found that the strength and modulus of the 3D
C-G hybrid composites were higher than that of the laminated C-G hybrid composites,
and the modulus of the 3D C-G hybrid composites was lower than that of the 3D carbon
ﬁber composites, but the failure strain and strength were higher than those of the 3D
carbon ﬁber composites. The study also found that the fracture origin of the 3D C-G hybrid
composites and 3D carbon ﬁber composites in static bending was from the kinking failure
and shearing failure of the top layer. The compression damage of warp and Z-binder
yarns was the main failure mode of fatigue testing. Guo et al. [14] studied the effect of
weaving parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D multi-angle interlocking woven
composite materials and found that weaving parameters have a greater inﬂuence on the
failure morphology of the material. Zheng et al. [4] established a mesoscopic model of
3D shallow bend-interlock composite materials, based on numerical simulations, to study
the damage mechanism of the material and conducted tensile experiments on the material
to verify the accuracy of the simulation. For 3D angle-interlock structural materials, the
current research on bulletproof ability mainly focuses on the fabric level, as illustrated in
the following studies. Yang et al. [15] conducted a ﬁnite element simulation of the ballistic
performance of 3D angle-interlock fabrics and 2D plain laminated fabrics, and found that
the 3D angle-interlock fabric ratio capacity absorbs higher than the 2D plain laminated
fabric; they also found that 3D fabrics have better surface diffusion capacity. Wei et al. [16]
conducted ballistic impact experiments on 3D deep-angle-interlock fabrics, which revealed
the impact damage evolution, energy absorption mechanism, and stress wave distribution
of 3D deep-angle-interlock fabrics.

Due to the limitations of weaving technology, the thickness of a single 3D fabric is
often limited to 1–6 mm [17–19], and the preparation of composite materials is still unable
to reach a high level of ballistic protection. Min et al. [20] analyzed the ballistic performance
of 3D deep-angle-interlock stacking layer armored materials of different structures from
the aspects of damage depth, scale-out, damage volume, etc., and found that the bullet-
proof effect of the ﬁve-layer deep-angle-interlock structure is better than that of the four-
layer deep-angle-interlock structure. However, the effect on the mechanical and ballistic
performance of the 3D deep-angle-interlock armored materials has not been sufﬁciently
studied, such as the series of fabric structure parameters, fabric stacking direction, and
resin content.

Therefore, to prepare three-dimensional deep-angle-interlock (3DDAI) Kevlar/EP
armor materials with excellent mechanical and ballistic properties, in this paper, 3DDAI
Kevlar fabric was used as the reinforcement and epoxy resin was used as the matrix to
study the inﬂuence of the bending properties. These include the number of stacking layers,
resin content, fabric weft density, and laying method. The work presented in this study
lays a foundation for subsequent research on the ballistic resistance of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP
armor materials.

2.2. Sample Preparation

We utilized the 300 mm × 300 mm 3D deep-angle-interlock Kevlar fabric as the
reinforcement. Epoxy resin E-51 and curing agent polyetheramine D230 were mixed
uniformly in the ratio of 4:1 as the matrix, and the vacuum-assisted molding process was
used to compound. The material was cut by the WG-1200 multifunctional ceramic tile
cutting machine, according to the experimental requirements, and the parameters of the
3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material sample are listed in Table 2.

The resin content/ﬁber volume fraction has an important inﬂuence on the mechanical
properties of the material [21–23], so it is necessary to control the resin content during the

The bending performance of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material was tested on the
Instron 5969 H universal material testing machine according to GB/T1449-2005 [24]. The
ratio of the bending span to the thickness of the pattern was 16:1. The bending test speed
was 2 mm/min. The preload was set to 3–8 N, and the load continues until the pattern fails.
In order to ensure the validity of the data, each data-point was tested at least ﬁve times,
and the average value was taken.

The bending stress was calculated using Equation (3); the bending strain was calcu-

lated using Equation (4); and the bending modulus was calculated using Equation (5).

and ∆S are the load increments of the initial line segment and the displacement increment

3. Results and Discussions
3.1. Effect of Stacking Layers of 3DDAI Kevlar Fabrics on Bending Properties

The 3DDAI fabric with a weft density of 50 picks/cm was used as the reinforce-
ment, and armor materials (resin content 44% ± 1%) of different fabric pieces were pre-
pared through the superimposition of the unidirectional laying method, including 3DDAI

Materials 2022, 15, 5321

5 of 18

Kevlar/EP armor materials made of single, two, three, and four fabric laminates. The warp
and weft directions of the material were tested for bending performance, respectively.

3.1.1. Bending Stress-Strain Curves

The bending stress-strain curves of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different

fabric layers are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. The bending stress-strain curve of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different
stacking layers. (a) The warp direction. (b) The weft direction.

It can be seen from Figure 2 that 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different
stacking layers have different bending stress-strain responses. Among them, the curve
characteristics of 1 to 2 layers are similar. The stress ﬁrst increases linearly with the strain,
then increases nonlinearly, and then decreases slowly after reaching the maximum value.
This is because Kevlar ﬁbers have good toughness, and the material failure is mainly due
to the decrease in stiffness caused by buckling deformation. The damage morphology of
1–2 layers of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials is shown in Figure 3. When there was only
one layer of fabric, the yarn did not break; when there were two layers of fabric, the local
yarn broke. The 3 to 4 layer bending curve characteristics are similar and are described as
follows: in the initial stage, the stress increases linearly with the strain; subsequently, the
stress increases nonlinearly with the strain; and then, the stress reaches its maximum value,
and the material fails. Finally, as the strain increases further, the stress drops sharply.

was analyzed by a LEICASAPO stereo microscope. Among them, the slope of the curve
was calculated with a strain of 0.002 mm/mm as the limit, and the test was stopped at
the point of sudden change of the slope to get the failure morphology of the material at
different stages, which is shown in Figures 4 and 5. In these pictures, we noticed that the B
and C points when the material was loaded in the weft direction come earlier than when
the material was loaded in the warp direction. This is because the buckled warp yarn in
the material has a higher failure strain than the straightened weft yarn. Among them, there
was no obvious damage to the material in the linear growth phase (AB section, A is the
curve’s starting point). In the non-linear growth stage (the BC section), the axial yarns in
the upper layer of the material accumulate damage, and the matrix is broken. When loaded
in the warp direction, it shows warp yarn damage and matrix fragmentation around the
interweaving point on the upper surface of the material, as shown in Figure 4c. When
loaded in the weft direction, it shows buckling and extrusion of the weft yarn in the upper
layer of the material and local cracking of the matrix, as shown in Figure 5c. The ultimate
failure of the material (point D) was caused by the fracture of the axial yarns in the bottom
layer of the material. When loaded in the warp direction, it appears that the underside
of the material has been broken, and the weft yarns have collapsed. The bottom warp
yarns located directly under the upper indenter broke ﬁrst and then spread in the thickness
direction, showing longitudinal cracks as shown in Figure 4d. When loaded in the weft
direction, it appears that the material’s bottom layer matrix was broken. The bottom weft
yarn, located directly under the upper indenter, breaks ﬁrst and then expands in the plane,
resulting in a diagonal breaking path of the weft yarn along the weaving point area, as
shown in Figure 5d.

3.1.2. Bending Properties

The bending properties of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different
superimposed layers are listed in Table 3. In order to more intuitively evaluate the inﬂuence
of different stacking layers on the bending properties of materials, the bending performance
comparison of different stacking layers of materials is shown in Figure 6.

It can be seen from Table 3 that: (1) The bending performance in the weft direction was
signiﬁcantly better than that in the warp direction. (2) When the number of stacked layers
reaches 3 layers, the bending strength was the largest (169.4 MPa along the warp direction
and 356 MPa along the weft direction). (3) When reaching 4 layers, the bending modulus
was the largest (in the warp direction: 5.75 GPa, along the weft direction: 19.52 GPa).

It can be seen from Figure 6 that the bending strength of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor
material ﬁrst increases with the number of fabric stacking layers, reaches a peak when the
number of stacking layers reaches three, and then decreases. According to the bending
strength formula, the bending strength of the material increases as a logarithmic function
with an increase in thickness. However, in George J. Dvorak’s study [25], it was found that
with the increase in the thickness of the laminate layer, the strength of the matrix in the
material decreased. Therefore, when the number of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armored material
overlays increases to a certain extent, the increase in bending strength is weaker than the
decrease in matrix strength, resulting in a decrease in the overall strength of the material.
The increase in the number of stacking layers in the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material
and the increase in the total amount of ﬁbers involved in resisting deformation shows that

Materials 2022, 15, 5321

7 of 18

the bending modulus of the material increases. However, the increase in bending module
decreases with the increase in the number of stacking layers due to the material’s resistance
to deformation by synergy between different layers, rather than the participation of all
areas of the material itself in resisting deformation.

3.2. Effect of Epoxy Resin Content on Bending Properties

The 3DDAI fabric with a weft density of 50 picks/cm was the reinforcement, and the
armor material, with different contents of epoxy resin, was prepared by the symmetrical
laying method, including resin contents of 34.27%, 36.75%, 40.39%, 44.61%, and 48.59% of the
3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials were tested in the warp and weft directions, respectively.

3.2.1. Bending Stress-Strain Curves

Figure 7 shows the bending stress-strain curves of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials
with different resin contents. In the ﬁgure, we found that the stress-strain curve of the
material was more unstable when the resin content was 34.27% (ﬁber volume content of
54.92%) and 36.75% (52.71%), which may be because the fabric structure of 3DDAI was
relatively loose and low resin content will result in more voids inside the material and thus
an unstable response of the material during the bending process. When the resin content
was 40.39% (48.94%), 44.61% (46.12%), and 48.59% (43.38%), the stress-strain curve of the
material was relatively stable, indicating that the resin content in this range can prepare
3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material with stable performance.

In the figure, we found that the stress-strain curve of the material was more unstable when the resin content was 34.27% (fiber volume content of 54.92%) and 36.75% (52.71%), which may be because the fabric structure of 3DDAI was relatively loose and low resin content will result in more voids inside the material and thus an unstable response of the material during the bending process. When the resin content was 40.39% (48.94%), 44.61% (46.12%), and 48.59% (43.38%), the stress-strain curve of the material was relatively stable, indicating that the resin content in this range can prepare 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material with stable performance.

Figure 8. Comparison of the bending strength of materials with different contents of epoxy resin.

As can be seen from Table 4, the resin content of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material’s
bending strength was the highest at 44.61% (along the warp direction: 206.8 MPa, along the
weft direction: 307 MPa), and the bending strength was the lowest when the resin content
was 34.27% (along the warp direction: 167 MPa, along the weft direction: 216.4 MPa).

As can be seen from Figure 8, the bending strength of the material increases with the
increase of the resin content when the resin content is increased from 34.27% to 44.61%.
When the resin content of the material is 44.61% to 48.59%, the bending strength decreases
with the increase of the epoxy resin content, but the degree of the decrease is not very
obvious. This is because if the resin content is too low, the matrix will be unable to play a
useful role in load transmission and reducing the synergy between ﬁbers and the matrix
will result in the lower material’s strength. However, if the resin content is excessively high,
the material strength will decrease too, due to the relative reduction of ﬁber as the carrier
main body [26,27]. Therefore, in the armor material preparation process, it could improve
the utilization rate of the material by controlling the appropriate resin content, and the
optimal resin content of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material should be controlled within
the range of 40% to 49%.

3.3. The Effect of Laying Method on Bending Properties

In the literature on woven and woven-composite ballistic materials, it was found that
the ballistic performance of quasi-isotropic materials in the macroscopic plane was better
than that of anisotropic materials in the macroscopic plane [28–30]. Therefore, the following
3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different laying methods were designed as far as
possible to be macro-quasi-isotropic except for the unidirectional laying materials.

The 3DDAI fabric, with a weft density of 50 picks/cm, was used as the reinforcement
and was combined with the resin system to prepare armor materials with different laying
methods. 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials (resin content 44% ± 1%) was prepared using
the unidirectional laying method, the orthogonal laying method, the symmetrical laying
method, and the 2/2 laying method, and bending performance tests were conducted along
the warp and weft directions, respectively. Figure 9 is a schematic diagram of different

From Table 5, we can observe that: (1) The nonlinear phase of the material lasts longer
and can absorb more energy. (2) In general, the order of fracture energy was orthogonal
laying method > symmetric laying method > unidirectional laying method > 2/2 laying
method. Furthermore, the fracture energy of the material of the orthogonal layer was about
20% higher than that of the material of the unidirectional layer. (3) The fracture energy of
the material whose bottom layer was in the weft direction (90◦) was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of the material whose bottom layer was in the warp direction (0◦). (4) The material
whose upper layer was in the warp direction shows higher ultimate strain at each stage
than the material whose upper layer was in the weft direction.

3.3.2. Bending Properties

The bending properties of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different laying
methods are listed in Table 6. It can be seen from the table that: (1) In the unidirectional
and symmetrical laying methods, the bending strength and bending modulus of the
armor material along the weft direction were far greater than the bending strength and
bending modulus of the material along the warp direction. (2) The bending strength
of the armor material along the weft direction was greater than the bending strength of
the material along the warp direction in the orthogonal and 2/2 laying methods, and
the bending modulus of the material in the warp direction was slightly greater than the
bending modulus of the material in the weft direction. (3) The bending properties of
the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different laying methods were different, and
the bending performance of the materials along the weft direction was in the order of
unidirectional laying method > symmetrical laying method > orthogonal laying method
> 2/2 laying method; the bending performance of the materials along the warp direction
was in the order of orthogonal laying method > 2/2 laying method > symmetrical laying
method > unidirectional laying method. (4) When the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material
was subjected to bending load, the upper and bottom layers of the material were the main
bodies that bore the load, and the stiffness contribution of the upper layer was greater than
the bottom layer; however, the strength contribution of the bottom layer was greater than
the upper layer.

In order to make the material appear quasi-isotropic in the macroscopic plane, the
mechanical properties of the material in different directions are improved by changing the
laying method. However, as was described above, there were still anisotropic features in
the material when bearing the bending load after changing the method of laying. Therefore,
we used Equation (6), the Coefﬁcient of Ascension (CA), to express the comprehensive
bending performance of the material relative to the unidirectional laying material, and
the difference between the bending properties of the material in different directions was
expressed by Equation (7), the Coefﬁcient of Difference (CD; the closer to 1, the smaller the
difference). A comparison of the bending coefﬁcients of the 3DDAI Kevlar and EP armor
materials in different laying methods was made, as shown in Figure 11.

QCA = (Q1/Qwarp + Q2/Qwe f t) · 1/2

where QCA is the Coefﬁcient of ascension, QCD is the coefﬁcient of difference, Q1 is the
bending performance of the material along the warp direction, Q2 is the bending perfor-
mance of the material along the weft direction, Qwarp is the bending performance of the
unidirectional laying material along the warp direction, Qweft is the bending performance

orthogonal laying materials was also very small. In summary, the preparation of 3DDAI
Kevlar/EP armor material by the orthogonal laying method is beneﬁcial to maximize
the potential to improve the comprehensive bending performance of the material, while
reducing the difference in bending performance between different directions of the material.

3.4. The Effect of Fabric Weft Density on Bending Properties

As noted above, the preparation of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials in an orthogonal
laying method was conducive to maximizing the potential to improve the comprehensive
bending performance of the material, while reducing the difference in bending performance
between different directions of the material. Therefore, armor materials were mainly
prepared by the orthogonal laying method to study the effect of different fabric weft
densities on the bending properties of the materials.

The 3DDAI fabrics with weft densities of 43, 46, and 50 picks/cm were used as rein-
forcements to prepare armor materials (resin content 46% ± 1%), and bending performance
tests were carried out along the material’s warp and weft direction. The bending properties
of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials with different weft densities are listed in Table 7.
In order to more intuitively evaluate the effect of different fabric weft densities on the
bending performance of the material, the comparison of the bending performances of
different fabric weft densities is shown in Figure 12.

As can be seen from Table 7, the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material has the high-
est bending strength at 43 picks/cm of weft density (along warp direction: 220.8 MPa,
along weft direction: 267.6 MPa), and the lowest bending modulus (along warp direc-
tion: 10.42 GPa, along weft direction: 8.81 GPa); when the weft density of the fabric was
50 picks/cm, the bending strength was the lowest (along the warp direction: 194.6 MPa,
along the weft direction: 238.7 MPa), and the bending modulus was the highest (along the
warp direction: 11 GPa, along the weft direction: 10.71 GPa).

As can be seen from Figure 12, when the weft density of the fabric increases from
43 picks/cm to 50 picks/cm, the bending strength of the material decreases with the
increase of the fabric weft density. The internal voids of the fabric are reduced when the
fabric weft density is increased, and the reason why the material can macroscopically
ensure the same resin content is that more resin accumulates on the surface of the material
to form a “resin-rich zone,” which means the material with the higher fabric weft density
actually has less resin content in the interior than the material with the lower fabric weft
density. Firstly, this is because the increase in the weft density causes the “lean resin zone”
in the material to be more prone to cracks. Secondly, due to the increase in the weft density,
the degree of squeezing inside the yarn increases and the internal stress increases, resulting
in a decrease in the overall bending strength of the material; these results were also found
in the study of HA Aisyah [31]. The bending modulus of the material increased as the fabric
weft density increased from 43 picks/cm to 50 picks/cm, and the increase in the bending
modulus of the material along the weft direction is greater than that of the material along
the warp direction. This is owing to the fact that when the material is subjected to bending
load, the upper layer bears the axial compressive loading while the bottom layer bears the
axial tensile loading [32]. With an increase in fabric weft density, the axial ﬁbers along the
weft direction increase and the transverse ﬁbers along the warp direction rise. On the other
hand, the axial mechanical properties of the ﬁbers far outperform the transverse mechanical
properties [33]. For the reasons stated above, the increase in the bending modulus of the
material along the weft direction is greater than the rise in the bending modulus of the
material along the warp direction.

3.5. The Effect of the Structure on Bending Properties

Many studies [8–10,34] compared the performance of woven composites with different
structures by controlling the material thickness and ensuring similar resin content/ﬁber
volume fraction. For bending properties, Khatkar et al. showed that the ﬂexural strength of
3D orthogonal composites was 50.7% higher than that of 2D plain composites. Therefore,
this article compares the bending properties of 3DDAI armor material (unidirectional
laying) and 2D plain weave laminated Kevlar/EP armor material by controlling the fabric
surface density and resin content to achieve a similar thickness and material density.
The speciﬁcations of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material and the 2D plain laminated
Kevlar/EP armor material are shown in Table 8.

Figure 13 shows the comparison of the bending properties of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP
armor material and the 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material. As can be seen
from the ﬁgure, the bending strength of 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor materials
was 304 MPa and the ﬂexural modulus was 15.48 GPa, which was lower than that of the
weft direction of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials but much higher than that of the warp
direction of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor materials. This is due to the 3DDAI structure being
through the buckled warp system in the thickness through the straightening weft system,
intertwined into a three-dimensional structure. This structure improves the mechanics
and structural integrity in the weft direction and thickness direction by sacriﬁcing the
mechanics of the warp direction.

Figure 13. Comparison of the bending properties of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material and the
2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material.

For further investigation, the bending failure morphology of the 2D plain laminated
Kevlar/EP armor material in Figure 14 was compared with the bending failure of the
3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material that was loaded in the weft direction as shown in
Figure 5d. The analysis revealed that, in contrast to the oblique fracture path presented
by the axial yarn of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material loaded along the weft direction,
the axial yarn of the 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material presents the horizontal
fracture path of the interwoven point area, and then fracture and delamination occur layer
by layer.

This indicates that the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material has better in-plane perfor-
mance in the weft direction. Additionally, since the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material along
the weft direction of the axial yarn (weft yarn) was actually larger than the 2D plain weave
laminated Kevlar/EP armor material, the bending performance of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP
armor material was superior to that of the 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material.

The analysis revealed that, in contrast to the oblique fracture path presented by the axial yarn of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material loaded along the weft direction, the axial yarn of the 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material presents the horizontal fracture path of the interwoven point area, and then fracture and delamination occur layer by layer.  Figure 14. Bending failure morphology of 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material. This indicates that the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material has better in-plane perfor-mance in the weft direction. Additionally, since the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material along the weft direction of the axial yarn (weft yarn) was actually larger than the 2D plain weave laminated Kevlar/EP armor material, the bending performance of the 3DDAI Kev-lar/EP armor material was superior to that of the 2D plain laminated Kevlar/EP armor material. Materials 2022, 15, 5321

4. Conclusions

Based on the potential of 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material in the ﬁeld of protection,
the bending mechanics response of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material was carried out in
terms of the number of fabric superimposed layers, resin content, laying method, and fabric
weft density, and then compared with the bending performance of 2D plain laminated
Kevlar/EP armor material. The following conclusions were obtained through research:

(1) When 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material is subjected to bending load, the upper and
bottom layers of the material become the main carrying bodies, which has a greater
impact on the initial stiffness and breaking strength of the material, respectively.
Wherein the bending response of the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material was nonlinear,
the damage of the upper layer in the axial yarn and the damage of the matrix leads to
the phenomenon of bending softening, and the fracture of the axial yarn in the bottom
layer is the main cause of the material failure.

(2) Due to the particularity of the 3DDAI fabric structure, when the material’s warp and
weft density are quite different, the utilization rate of the yarn and the strength will
decrease. Furthermore, its loose structure needs to be appropriately increased in the
resin content to prepare stable armor materials, where the appropriate range of resin
content is 40%–49%. In addition, the 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor can be prepared by the
orthogonal laying method to improve the macroscopic mechanical properties of the
material and effectively increase the fracture energy of the material.

(3) The 3DDAI Kevlar/EP armor material was in-plane anisotropic, and its bending
performance along the weft direction was better than the 2D plain laminated material.
Additionally, due to the penetration of the yarns in the thickness direction in the
3DDAI structure, even the lamination can effectively slow down the delamination of
the material.
