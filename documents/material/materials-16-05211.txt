Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of gypsum-based humidity-control material. The material
combines gypsum–silica gel humidity-control material with 20% sepiolite powder activated by
calcium chloride. Both experimental and simulation studies were conducted to assess its humidity-
control performance. The experimental results indicate that gypsum-based humidity-control material
has the property of absorbing moisture in high-humidity environments and releasing moisture in
low-humidity environments. Moreover, both environmental temperature and relative humidity (RH)
have an impact on the material’s humidity-control performance. At a relative humidity of 97.4%,
the maximum equilibrium moisture content of the material is 0.225 g/g, which is 1.4 times that of
the gypsum–silica gel humidity-control material and 4.5 times that of pure gypsum material. The
simulation results indicate that gypsum-based humidity-control material effectively mitigates indoor
relative humidity ﬂuctuations and maintains indoor air relative humidity within a narrow range.
Furthermore, the material has the potential to reduce building energy consumption. This is especially
evident under climate conditions with large temperature and relative humidity differences between
day and night, such as in Beijing, Paris, and Atlanta. The maximum potential energy-saving rate in
Beijing can reach up to 19.31%.

1. Introduction

The indoor environment plays a crucial role in determining individuals’ physical and
mental well-being, a relationship that is primarily affected by indoor environmental param-
eters [1–3]. Relative humidity is one such parameter that significantly influences thermal
comfort, building load, indoor air quality, and occupant work efficiency [4,5]. To create a
comfortable indoor environment, it is pivotal to regulate relative humidity based on active
or passive methods. The former involves using heat, ventilation, and air conditioning
systems to either humidify or dehumidify indoor air, thereby keeping relative humidity
at cozy levels for occupants. However, this method consumes energy and causes envi-
ronmental pollution, undermining China’s strategy for renewable energy development.
Reports indicate an average annual growth rate of 5.39% in China’s energy consumption
during building operations from 2005 to 2018 [6]. In contrast, the latter method utilizes
renewable energy or materials with moisture absorption and desorption capabilities. This
approach aims to achieve the same goal of enhancing comfort while reducing building
energy consumption [7–9]. This ecological approach holds great signiﬁcance for improving
indoor living space and building energy conservation.

As a passive energy-saving technology for regulating indoor humidity, humidity-
control materials stand out among numerous passive technologies. The concept of humidity-
control materials was initially proposed by Nishito and Miyano in Japan in the 1940s [10].
It refers to the method of automatically regulating indoor air humidity without relying on
energy-consuming equipment, based on the moisture absorption and desorption charac-
teristics of the material. It is acknowledged as an environmentally benign passive control

method. It can manage indoor relative humidity ﬂuctuations and maintain indoor relative
humidity within a comfortable range, thereby avoiding negative impacts on human health
caused by high or low relative humidity environments [11,12].

In recent years, the utilization of humidity-control materials for regulating indoor
relative humidity has yielded promising results [13–15]. Zhang’s experimentation with
humidity-control materials placed in an artiﬁcial climate chamber indicated their effec-
tiveness in regulating indoor humidity levels [16]. Ge’s inquiry focused on the moisture
buffering performance of common humidity-control materials. The results revealed sig-
niﬁcant variations in the moisture absorption and desorption capabilities across similar
materials [17]. Simonson’s numerical simulation study demonstrated that incorporating
humidity-control materials in indoor spaces led to a reduction in required ventilation rates.
Importantly, this reduction was achieved without compromising comfort or air quality [18].
Zhang’s application of numerical simulation techniques revealed the signiﬁcant impact
of humidity-control materials on building energy consumption in different climatic condi-
tions. This study highlights their potential for up to 25% energy savings in temperate and
semi-arid climates [19].

Currently, various types of humidity-control materials have been developed and
classiﬁed as biomass, organic, inorganic, and composite materials [20]. Biomass materials
have relatively large moisture capacity, but they exhibit smaller vapor permeability and
slower moisture transfer rate [21]. Organic materials can absorb moisture hundreds of
times their own weight, but they have weaker desorption ability [22]. Inorganic materials
possess open porous structures and strong adsorption capabilities. Among them, gypsum
is a widely used lightweight construction material known for its cost-effectiveness and
eco-friendly production process. Its high porosity and uniform pore size distribution
enable favorable permeability, making it suitable for humidity-control applications. Roel
investigated the moisture absorption and desorption performance of gypsum boards
coated with latex paint compared to bare gypsum boards. The ﬁndings indicated that
applying latex paint on the surface of gypsum boards signiﬁcantly diminishes their moisture
buffering capacity [23]. Zhang evaluated the humidity-control capabilities of magnesite
board, diatomaceous earth, and gypsum board. The results revealed that they all possess
varying degrees of humidity-control capabilities, with magnesite board performing the best,
followed by diatomaceous earth, and gypsum board performing poorly [24]. Shahrzad
found that placing gypsum inside concrete walls under higher indoor ventilation rates can
maintain indoor relative humidity at approximately 60% [25]. Although gypsum possesses
certain moisture control capabilities, it presents two limitations in terms of its moisture
absorption and desorption performance. Firstly, within the relative humidity range of
40–70%, gypsum exhibits relatively low equilibrium moisture content, which fails to meet
the demand for substantial moisture absorption within the standard humidity range.
Secondly, gypsum displays a slow rate of moisture absorption and desorption, making it
challenging to promptly respond to dynamic humidity changes.

To enhance the humidity-control performance of gypsum, numerous researchers have
chosen gypsum as the matrix and incorporated other materials to develop gypsum-based
composite materials [26,27]. Jiang employed sepiolite powder activated by calcium chlo-
ride as an additive and incorporated it into gypsum to prepare a composite material. The
adsorption and desorption performance were tested, revealing that the adsorption and
desorption capacity of the samples increased with the increase in the dosage of activated
sepiolite powder. However, with a continuous increase in the content of activated sepiolite
powder, wetting phenomena were observed on the sample surface. Consequently, the
optimal additive content was found to be 20% of activated sepiolite powder [28]. Shang
introduced lithium chloride into gypsum and developed a novel material. The research in-
dicated that this material exhibited good humidity absorption and desorption performance,
with a maximum moisture absorption capacity of 0.410 g/g [29]. Lee added activated
clay into gypsum to fabricate a new gypsum-based composite material. The experimental
results showed that the humidity absorption and desorption performance of the material

Materials 2023, 16, 5211

improved with an increasing amount of clay addition, reaching its peak when the clay
content reached 70% [30]. Shang successfully developed a gypsum-based humidity-control
material by mixing it with adsorbent materials such as plant ﬁber, kaolin, and activated
carbon [31].

In conclusion, gypsum is a traditional building material with humidity-control proper-
ties, but it has limitations in terms of moisture absorption and desorption performance. The
current focus of research lies on composite humidity-control materials [32,33], but there
has been no study on the preparation of a novel composite material by mixing gypsum
with silica gel. Therefore, in previous studies, the author employed silica gel as a functional
material to modify gypsum and prepare a gypsum–silica gel composite [34]. Through ex-
perimental measurements, the composite material exhibited markedly enhanced moisture
absorption and desorption capacity as well as rate compared to pure gypsum. To further
enhance the humidity-control capabilities of this composite material, we developed a novel
gypsum-based humidity-control material. This was achieved by adding sepiolite powder
activated by calcium chloride at a mass ratio of 20%, based on existing research [28,35]. The
humidity-control performance of the material was then evaluated through experiments and
simulated tests. The study aims to provide a new idea for continuously seeking low-cost
and practical humidity-control building materials suitable for the construction ﬁeld.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials

The study used gypsum material and calcium chloride from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Silica gel was obtained from Henan Pubang Environ-
mental Protection Materials Co., Ltd., Henan, China. Sepiolite powder was provided by
Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. The preparation process of
gypsum-based humidity-control material is described as follows.

2.1.1. Preparation of Activated Sepiolite Powder

The sepiolite powder was placed in an air-drying oven (10HS, made in China) to
dry at a temperature of 90 ◦C until the change in weight did not exceed 0.1% over three
consecutive days. Subsequently, a 3 mol/L calcium chloride solution was formulated and
blended with the dried sepiolite powder at a mass ratio of 8:2 with the aid of an electronic
balance (TP-213, accuracy: ±0.01 g). The mixture was subsequently homogenized using a
glass rod until it attained a dry and friable consistency to obtain sepiolite power activated
by calcium chloride.

2.1.2. Preparation of Gypsum–Silica Gel Humidity-Control Material

Firstly, the silica gel was crushed using a crusher (MT-10S, made in China) and sieved
through a mesh to obtain 3 mm particle-size silica gel. Then, gypsum and silica gel were
separately weighed in a mass ratio of 6:4 using an electronic balance (TP-213, accuracy:
±0.01 g). After thoroughly mixing the materials in a beaker, the desired amount of distilled
water was added and stirred well. Finally, the well-mixed composite slurry was poured
into a precast mold with dimensions of 50 × 50 × 5 mm and allowed to solidify. It was
then cured for 24 h at a temperature of 50 ± 2 ◦C and a relative humidity of 40 ± 5%. This
resulted in the formation of the gypsum–silica gel humidity-control material. The detailed
preparation procedure can be found in reference [34].

2.1.3. Preparation of Gypsum-Based Humidity-Control Material

The uncured gypsum–silica gel humidity-control material slurry was mixed with acti-
vated sepiolite powder in a mass ratio of 8:2. The mixture was poured into a beaker and the
desired amount of distilled water was added, then stirred thoroughly to achieve uniformity.
The well-mixed composite slurry was poured into a precast mold with dimensions of 50 ×

2.2.1. Experimental Testing

1. Humidity-control performance

To test the humidity-control performance of the gypsum-based humidity-control
material, two experimental schemes were designed. First, the gypsum-based humidity-
control material was used to dehumidify and humidify high-humidity (85%) and low-
humidity (25%) environments consecutively. This continuous humidity-control test was
repeated three times. Second, the gypsum-based humidity-control material was used
to dehumidify the high-humidity environment (85%) and immediately humidify the
low-humidity environment (25%). This intermittent humidity-control test was repeated
three times.

The experimental setup design schematic diagram illustrated in Figure 2a consisted
of a box and an adsorbent cylinder situated outside it. The outer magnet block slid
along the outer guide rail, controlling the inner magnet block inside the box via magnetic
attraction. This allowed for the opening or sealing of the partition between the box and
the adsorbent cylinder as required. The experiment involved establishing high- or low-
humidity conditions within the box by humidifying or dehumidifying through the piston
port. After that, the dehumidiﬁcation and humidiﬁcation process was initiated by opening
the sealing partition using the outer magnet block. In situ relative humidity measurements
were performed using a temperature and humidity recorder (AZ8829, made in China)
placed in the box every minute. The experimental temperature was maintained at 23 ◦C.
The actual image of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 2b.

It was then cured for 24 h at a temperature of 50 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 40 ± 5%. This resulted in the formation of the gyp-sum-based humidity-control material.

were placed in an air-drying oven to dry at a temperature of 80 ◦C until the change in
weight did not exceed 0.1% over three consecutive days. The dry materials were placed
in the chamber with a constant relative humidity of 80% to absorb moisture. In contrast,
the materials that had reached the maximum equilibrium moisture absorption at a relative

formance of gypsum-based humidity-control material, the internal temperature of the
programmable temp&humi chamber was kept at 23 ◦C. The dry materials were placed

controlled at a constant level of 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. The materials that
had reached the maximum equilibrium moisture absorption at a relative humidity of 97.4%
were placed in the chamber to desorb moisture. Inside the chamber, the relative humidity
was controlled at constant levels of 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, respectively.

To test the energy-saving effect of gypsum-based humidity-control material applied in
buildings, EnergyPlus software was used. The study focused on investigating the impact
of the laying and non-laying of material on building energy consumption under various

selected for analysis. These cities include Beijing, China (continental monsoon climate),
Paris, France (temperate oceanic climate), Atlanta, United States (subtropical and sub-
humid climate), and Xiamen, China (subtropical oceanic monsoon climate).

For accurate and typical results, the BESTEST base case building (shown in Figure 4)

3.1.1. Humidity-Control Performance

The results of the continuous dehumidiﬁcation and humidiﬁcation tests of the gypsum-
based humidity-control material are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows the results of
continuous dehumidiﬁcation tests. These results reveal that the dehumidiﬁcation capacity
of the material continuously decreases during three consecutive dehumidiﬁcation tests.
The ﬁrst dehumidiﬁcation reduces the relative humidity from 85% to 68%, the second
dehumidiﬁcation reduces it to 70%, and the third dehumidiﬁcation only reduces it to 72%.
Figure 5b presents the results of continuous humidiﬁcation tests. These results demonstrate
that the humidiﬁcation capacity of the material exhibits a continuing downward trend
during three consecutive humidiﬁcation. The ﬁrst humidiﬁcation increases the relative
humidity from 25% to 45%, the second humidiﬁcation increases it to 43%, and the third
humidiﬁcation only increases it to 41%.

The results of the intermittent dehumidiﬁcation and humidiﬁcation tests of the
gypsum-based humidity-control material are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows the
results of intermittent dehumidiﬁcation tests. These results reveal that there is no atten-
uation in the dehumidiﬁcation ability of the material during the three dehumidiﬁcation
tests. The relative humidity inside the box can be reduced from 85% to 70% in 130, 170,
and 100 min for the ﬁrst, second, and third dehumidiﬁcation, respectively. Additionally,
all three dehumidiﬁcation tests achieve a stabilized relative humidity of 65% ± 2% within
200 min. Figure 6b shows the results of intermittent humidiﬁcation tests. These results
demonstrate that there is also no attenuation in the humidiﬁcation ability of the material
during the three humidiﬁcation tests. The relative humidity can be increased from 25% to
40% in 100, 150, and 110 min for the ﬁrst, second, and third humidiﬁcation, respectively.
Additionally, all three humidiﬁcation tests can stabilize the relative humidity at 43% ± 2%
within 200 min.

Figure 7 illustrates the absorption and desorption of the moisture content variations
of gypsum-based humidity control under different ambient temperatures. As observed
in Figure 7a, all dry materials under various ambient temperatures reached absorption
moisture equilibrium after 100 h. Notably, there is a 2% increase in the equilibrium moisture
absorption content when the ambient temperature changes from 13 ◦C to 33 ◦C. As ob-
served in Figure 7b, all the materials that had reached the maximum equilibrium moisture
absorption at a relative humidity of 97.4% under various ambient temperatures reached
desorption moisture equilibrium after 100 h. The moisture desorption content also increases

by 6%, when the ambient temperature increases from 13 ◦C to 33 ◦C. Observations demon-
strate that alterations in ambient temperature minimally impact the moisture absorption
content of the material. However, temperature ﬂuctuations signiﬁcantly affect the moisture
desorption content of the material. The presence of silica gel in gypsum-based hygroscopic
materials can account for this phenomenon. With increasing ambient temperature, the
moisture absorption capacity of silica gel strengthens, consequently enhancing the moisture
absorption capacity of the material.

Figure 8 illustrates the absorption and desorption moisture content variations of
gypsum-based humidity control under different ambient relative humidities. As depicted
in Figure 8a, the material’s moisture absorption content was augmented by 6% upon an
increase in relative humidity from 50% to 80%. This increase culminated at 15.88% at a
relative humidity of 80%. As demonstrated in Figure 8b, the material’s moisture desorption
content was augmented by 6% upon a decline in relative humidity from 50% to 20%. This
increase culminated at 9.02% at a relative humidity of 20%. The experimental outcomes
evince that the ambient relative humidity engenders an inﬂuence on both moisture ab-
sorption and desorption content of the material. Additionally, the greater the gap between
the ambient relative humidity and the internal moisture content of the material, the more
superior its performance in regulating moisture.

that the gypsum-based humidity-control material exhibited signiﬁcantly superior moisture
absorption and desorption performance compared to the other two materials. The humidity-
control performance ranking was determined as follows: gypsum-based humidity-control

0.225 g/g at 97.4% relative humidity. This value exceeded that of the gypsum–silica

sepiolite powder activated by calcium chloride resulted in further enhancement of the

3.2. Simulation Testing
3.2.1. The Impact of Material Thickness on Indoor Air Parameters

After conducting a simulated study on the impact of different thicknesses of materials
laid on the interior of rooms under Xiamen’s summer climate conditions. These results
are illustrated in Figure 10. The study found that the temperature trends of rooms with
different thickness materials were similar. It was observed that as the thickness increased,
the average indoor air temperature slightly increased. The average temperature of the
room with a 0.05 m thickness material was 0.26 ◦C higher than that with a 0.01 m thickness
material. Furthermore, the relative humidity in rooms with different thickness materials
could be stabilized within the range of 40% to 70%. After laying the 0.05 m thick material,
the change in indoor air relative humidity was the smallest and the trend was the most
stable. However, there was not a signiﬁcant difference compared to other thicknesses.
The mean relative humidity of rooms with a 0.05 m thickness material was only 0.78%
lower than rooms with a 0.01 m thickness material. In conclusion, the variation in material
thickness has a negligible effect on indoor air parameters. This may be due to the large
range of the laying area, and the change in material thickness almost does not affect the
total amount of material used.

Figure 10. The impact of material thickness on (a) indoor temperature; (b) indoor relative humidity.

Based on the simulation results, the optimal thickness value of the material cannot
be determined solely by changes in indoor air parameters. However, a speciﬁc thickness
value needs to be determined in subsequent simulations. Figure 11 shows the energy
consumption of the room with different thickness materials laid on the inside of the room.
As apparent from Figure 11, as the laying thickness increases, energy consumption shows a
signiﬁcant downward trend. It is worth noting that when the laying thickness is 0.03 m,
0.04 m, and 0.05 m, the energy consumption is relatively close, at 89 ± 1 kwh/m2, which is
signiﬁcantly better than the energy consumption of 0.01 m and 0.02 m. Compared with
laying thicknesses of 0.01 m and 0.02 m, energy efﬁciency has been improved by 7.25% and

After laying the 0.05 m thick material, the change in indoor air relative humidity was the smallest and the trend was the most stable. However, there was not a signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared to other thicknesses. The mean relative humidity of rooms with a 0.05 m thickness material was only 0.78% lower than rooms with a 0.01 m thickness material. In conclusion, the variation in material thick-ness has a negligible eﬀect on indoor air parameters. This may be due to the large range of the laying area, and the change in material thickness almost does not aﬀect the total amount of material used.  Figure 10.

Compared with laying thicknesses of 0.01 m and 0.02 m, energy eﬃciency has been improved by 7.25% and 3.17%, respectively. Considering economic factors, we choose 0.03 m as the laying thickness for subsequent simulations. Materials 2023, 16, 5211

for subsequent simulations.

3.2.2. The Impact of Material Area on Indoor Air Parameters

Then, a simulated study was conducted on the impact of different areas of materials
laid on the interior of rooms on the indoor air parameters under Xiamen’s summer climate
conditions. These results are illustrated in Figure 12. Figure 12a reveals that the average
room temperature with laid material is higher than that without it, and the indoor tempera-
ture intensiﬁes as the area of the material increases. This can be attributed to the exchange
of outdoor heat into the indoor environment. It occurs due to high outdoor temperatures
combined with strong sunlight, where the material retains some of the indoor heat load.
As a result, there is an increase in the average indoor temperature. Figure 12b deduces that
relative humidity outside remains high for most of the time. During the air conditioning
operation period (8:00–18:00), both rooms exhibit comfortable levels of relative humidity.
However, when the air conditioning is turned off, the relative humidity in the room with-
out laid material may reach 80%, while the room with laid material can maintain indoor
relative humidity at around 65%. This implies that the material has the potential to regulate
indoor humidity ﬂuctuations and stabilize indoor relative humidity within a narrow range
as the area increases. Compared to the room without laid material and the room with a
63.6 m2 area, the room with a 159.6 m2 area exhibits a smaller amplitude of moisture
content ﬂuctuation.

3.2.3. Analysis of Energy-Saving

Table 6 presents a comparative analysis of the annual energy consumption and energy-
saving efﬁciency achieved by using gypsum-based humidity-control material in the interior
of buildings located in different cities. These cities include Beijing, Paris, Atlanta, and
Xiamen. The analysis reveals that the energy-saving efﬁciencies for these cities are 19.31%,
18.48%, 18.04%, and 10.81%, respectively. These ﬁndings demonstrate that the utilization of
such material can effectively reduce building energy consumption, and their energy-saving
effect is substantial. However, in Xiamen’s hot and humid climate, it should be noted
that high outdoor temperatures elevate the thermal load accumulated by the material.
Additionally, the outdoor relative humidity impedes the desorption process of the material,
leading to suboptimal discharge of internal moisture. Consequently, in areas with large
temperature and relative humidity ﬂuctuations throughout the year, such as Beijing, Paris,
and Atlanta, the materials manifest excellent energy-saving capabilities. This suggests
that if the heat and moisture retained by the material are expelled promptly, and the heat
dissipation and desorption processes are facilitated, the energy-saving performance of the
material will improve.

Through the analysis of experimental results, it was found that intermittent dehu-
midiﬁcation and humidiﬁcation have shown more beneﬁcial long-term performance for
the material compared to continuous dehumidiﬁcation and humidiﬁcation. Moreover,
although high temperature can promote the desorption process of gypsum-based humidity-
control material, its desorption capacity is still limited under continuously high-humidity
conditions. In contrast to temperature, relative humidity has a more signiﬁcant impact on
the material’s humidity-control performance.

The simulation results also conﬁrmed the ﬁndings.

In climates characterized by
sustained high temperature and humidity, such as Xiamen, outdoor high temperature
increases the accumulated heat load on the material. Additionally, outdoor high humidity
hinders the desorption process, resulting in suboptimal discharge of internal moisture.
Conversely, in regions with greater ﬂuctuations in temperature and relative humidity
throughout the year, such as Beijing, Paris, and Atlanta, the material exhibits excellent
energy-saving performance.

To better elucidate this ﬁnding, Xiamen was taken as an example to categorize the im-
pact of gypsum-based humidity-control material on annual building energy consumption
according to the seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The results are presented in
Figure 13. During spring, it can be observed that there is a large temperature and relative
humidity difference between daytime and nighttime. The temperature is higher during
the day, and the relative humidity is lower. Under this circumstance, the material can
absorb the heat from the surrounding environment by releasing the moisture stored in
the internal capillary pores, thereby effectively reducing the indoor temperature. Con-
versely, at night, the temperature drops, and the relative humidity increases, allowing the
material to absorb moisture from the air that condenses inside the material and releases
heat, leading to an increase in indoor temperature. Consequently, this material exhibits
excellent energy-saving performance during spring. During summer, due to the continuous

Materials 2023, 16, 5211

14 of 16

high temperature and humidity in Xiamen, the internal waste heat and moisture are not
fully discharged and released. As a result, this limits the energy-saving capacity of the
material. Similarly, during autumn, although outdoor temperature and humidity decrease
relative to summer, they remain relatively high overall. This indicates that the material
cannot efﬁciently discharge excess internal heat and moisture, thereby resulting in weak
energy-saving performance. During winter, it exhibits similar characteristics to spring,
with signiﬁcant diurnal temperature variation and relative humidity. However, the average
temperature and average relative humidity are the lowest throughout the year, with an
average temperature of 17.43 ◦C and an average relative humidity of 58.3%. During the
daytime, the temperature is relatively high, and the humidity is lower. This creates an
environment where the material can release moisture from its pores, effectively reducing
the indoor temperature and decreasing the cooling load on air conditioning. However, as
the nighttime temperature drops, the remaining moisture may further lower the indoor
temperature, increasing the heating load on air conditioning. Overall, the material still
demonstrates good energy-saving effects in winter.

5. Conclusions

To improve the humidity-control performance of traditional building materials and
augment their efﬁcacy in regulating indoor relative humidity, this study incorporated
sepiolite powder activated by calcium chloride into gypsum–silica gel humidity-control
material to prepare a new type of gypsum-based humidity-control material. Through
experimental and simulation studies, the following main conclusions were drawn:

(1) Gypsum-based humidity-control material exhibits the ability to absorb moisture in
high-humidity environments and desorb moisture in low-humidity environments. How-
ever, the material’s humidity-control capacity decreases over time during continuous
dehumidiﬁcation or humidiﬁcation. Therefore, intermittent dehumidiﬁcation and humidi-
ﬁcation are more conducive to maintaining relative humidity stability for extended periods
of time.

(2) The moisture absorption content of the gypsum-based humidity-control material
is minimally inﬂuenced by changes in environmental temperatures, while its moisture
desorption content is noticeably affected. On the other hand, variations in relative humidity
impact both the moisture adsorption and desorption content of the material. The larger the
discrepancy between environmental relative humidity and the internal moisture content of
the material, the greater the effectiveness of the material’s humidity-control performance.

Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 18   Conversely, at night, the temperature drops, and the relative humidity increases, allowing the material to absorb moisture from the air that condenses inside the material and re-leases heat, leading to an increase in indoor temperature. Consequently, this material ex-hibits excellent energy-saving performance during spring. During summer, due to the continuous high temperature and humidity in Xiamen, the internal waste heat and mois-ture are not fully discharged and released. As a result, this limits the energy-saving capac-ity of the material. Similarly, during autumn, although outdoor temperature and humid-ity decrease relative to summer, they remain relatively high overall. This indicates that the material cannot eﬃciently discharge excess internal heat and moisture, thereby resulting in weak energy-saving performance. During winter, it exhibits similar characteristics to spring, with signiﬁcant diurnal temperature variation and relative humidity. However, the average temperature and average relative humidity are the lowest throughout the year, with an average temperature of 17.43 °C and an average relative humidity of 58.3%. During the daytime, the temperature is relatively high, and the humidity is lower. This creates an environment where the material can release moisture from its pores, eﬀectively reducing the indoor temperature and decreasing the cooling load on air conditioning. However, as the nighttime temperature drops, the remaining moisture may further lower the indoor temperature, increasing the heating load on air conditioning. Overall, the ma-terial still demonstrates good energy-saving eﬀects in winter.  Figure 13. Energy consumption of Xiamen oﬃce buildings in (a) spring, (b) summer, (c) autumn, and (d) winter. 5.

(3) Addition of calcium-chloride-activated sepiolite powder signiﬁcantly enhances
the adsorption and desorption abilities of the gypsum–silica gel humidity-control material.
At a relative humidity of 97.4%, the equilibrium moisture content of the gypsum-based
humidity-control material can reach a maximum of 0.225 g/g. It is 1.4 times higher than
that of gypsum–silica gel material, and 4.5 times than that of pure gypsum materials.

(4) Gypsum-based humidity-control material can mitigate the inﬂuence of exterior and
interior humidity loads on indoor relative humidity. The material can reduce ﬂuctuations
in indoor relative humidity and maintain it within a narrow range, providing a more stable
indoor environment.

(5) Gypsum-based humidity-control material has the potential to reduce building
energy consumption. Simulation results show that compared with regions with high
temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, this material is more suitable for
areas with large diurnal temperature differences and differences in relative humidity.

The uniqueness of this study lies in the successful preparation of a novel gypsum-based
humidity-control material. It provides a new approach for low-cost and practical humidity-
control building materials in the ﬁeld of architecture. However, there are still several
limitations to be considered. This study explores the practical application of gypsum-based
humidity-control materials through simulation research methods. Further work requires
long-term monitoring and analysis in actual architectural environments to evaluate their
actual moisture regulation performance. Additionally, during the preparation process
of gypsum-based composite materials, the silica gel and activated sepiolite powder as
additives signiﬁcantly enhance the moisture absorption and desorption properties of the
materials. However, considering that silica gel itself belongs to a “strong absorption and
weak desorption” material, it leads to relatively poor desorption performance of gypsum-
based materials. The next focus of research will concentrate on exploring modiﬁcation
methods to improve the moisture desorption performance of the materials. Simultaneously,
it aims to achieve cost reduction objectives and ensure meet energy-saving requirements in
continuous high-temperature and high-humidity environments.
