Abstract

The identification of ancient worked materials is one of the fundamental goals of lithic use
wear analysis and one of the most important parts of understanding how stone tools were
used in the past. Given the documented overlaps in wear patterns generated by different
materials, it is imperative to understand how individual materials’ mechanical properties
might influence wear formation. Because isolating physical parameters and measuring their
change is necessary for such an endeavor, controlled (rather than replicative) experiments
combined with objective measurements of surface topography are necessary to better
grasp how surface modifications formed on stone tools. Therefore, we used a tribometer to
wear natural flint surfaces against five materials (bone, antler, beech wood, spruce wood,
and ivory) under the same force, and speed, over one, three, and five hours. The study
aimed to test if there is a correlation between surface modifications and the hardness of the
worked material. We measured each raw material’s hardness using a nano-indentation test,
and we compared the surface texture of the flint bits using a 3D optical profilometer. The
interfacial detritus powder was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope to look for
abraded flint particles. We demonstrate that, contrary to expectation, softer materials, such
as wood, create a smoother surface than hard ones, such as ivory.

Introduction

Along with the study of ancient residues, microscopic use wear analysis (MWA) is one of the
two major and complementary methods of lithic traceology [1], the science of forensically
interpreting ancient stone tool use. Despite its immense interpretive potential, its early spec-
tacular results [e.g., 2] were tempered by the blind testing crisis of the 1980s [3, 4], which put
into question different researchers’ ability to identify the same worked materials. Despite

PLOS ONEThe effect of worked material hardness on stone tool wear

many advances since the 1980s [see 5–8 for reviews], the identification of different worked
materials is still considered an insufficiently developed area. This is a major setback for prehis-
torians, because residues are not always preserved, and knowing which materials were worked
can make an enormous difference in interpreting area or site function, or in claims about style
and cultural transmission. Among use-wear micro-traces, researchers often refer to polish as
glossy areas observable on stone tools and related to these uses. Polish has been found useful in
identifying and distinguishing the worked material [2, 9–14].

The problem is manifold: not all polishes are equally easy to see and interpret, and not all
types of data deliver the same answers. Some types of materials, such as cereals [15, 16] or ant-
ler, bone, and ivory (ABI) have been identified consistently in blind tests or have been sepa-
rated quantitatively in experimental settings with varying degrees of success (see [9–11, 17,
18]). Traces left by others, especially by soft and elastic materials, such as meat, tendons, etc.,
are less identifiable [19]. Profilometers, instruments used to extract micro-surface texture of
samples, give the possibility to quantify polish formed on stone tools. Because profilometers
measure the texture of the surface and not its glossiness, it is more correct to use “surface mod-
ifications” instead of polish when describing samples analyzed with profilometers, therefore
this is the term we chose to use in this paper. Several quantitative studies conducted with pro-
filometers did report success in distinguishing target materials, but, even here, within-group
similarities were not adequately explained. For example, Stevens et al.’s [10] discriminant func-
tions grouped surface modifications caused by antler-working and plant-working. Moreover,
some studies could not clearly distinguish surface texture modifications caused by wood-work-
ing [20] and hide-working [13] from unworked areas. In one of the most recent studies, Iba´ñez
et al. [17] report a similar overlap between some contact materials in their quantitative analysis
to those noted by both other quantitative studies and also in blind tests [e.g., 21], despite study-
ing one of the largest samples to date. We cannot understand why attempts to classify surface
modifications produced by different worked materials fail or produce ambiguous results
because the processes that lead to these differences and similarities in surface modifications
are not sufficiently well understood.

One obvious way to resolve this problem is to study the mechanical properties of prehistoric

target (worked) materials and test their effects on wear development. Unfortunately, these
materials are not commonly studied by scientists and engineers who study wear processes (tri-
bologists), as they have no industrial applications. They are also more variable than industrial
ones, as the available data show. For example, the varying amount of mineralization in bone,
ivory, and antler causes mechanical properties to also vary among species [22], in some cases
significantly so [23]). Further, these materials change their properties when they are wet vs.
dry [24], or in very cold weather conditions [particularly ivory, see 25]. While some have
claimed that this produces different traces on stone tools, why that might happen remains
insufficiently explained.

Visible wear traces on stone tool surfaces are currently thought to result from the abrasion

of the natural roughness peaks [26–28]. In Schmidt et al. (2020) [28], we recently demon-
strated that the main competing model, which asserts that polish is a deposited layer formed
by a chemical reaction between the stone surface and the worked material tested in this experi-
ment [29–31], is not correct. Given that the literature abounds in mentions of hardness as a
way to group materials, it makes sense to test first the effect of hardness [e.g. 4, 10, 11, 32, 33].
Until now, systematic mechanical tests of archaeologically-relevant target materials have not
been incorporated into lithic use-wear research. In particular, hardness tests were carried out
on the stones themselves [34–37], but not on the target materials. For this reason, we decided
to carry out a test of the target materials’ hardnesses and to evaluate their role in abrading flint

with the expectation that the harder the worked material is the more surface modifications will
develop on flint.

Method
Experimental setup

Experiment principle. To isolate the effect of target materials hardness while maintaining

reasonable costs and effort, we opted for a tightly controlled protocol [38, 39]. Flint bits (Bal-
tic/morainic flint from Denmark with nano-crystalline non-oriented chalcedony texture [28])
were rubbed against dry bone (cow bone (Bos)), antler (deer (Cervidae)), ivory (African Ele-
phant ivory donated to NYU from customs at JFK Airport), and wood (beech and spruce,
store-bought) using a tribometer at room temperature. The study included a total of eight (8)
flint samples (one sample worked on beech wood, one sample worked on spruce wood, two
samples worked on ivory, two samples worked on antler, and two samples worked on bone).
The number of flint samples is quite small. However, given the tight controls this is sufficient,
because 3–5 surface measurements were taken for each stage of abrasion. The experiment was
sequential: the flint samples were mounted on the tribometer (Nanovea T-50) (Fig 1) and used
for one, three, and five hours. The tribometer variables were fixed to a load of 20N, a speed of
35 revolutions per minute and a straight back and forth motion.

General working principle of the tribometer. Tribometers help replicate real-life appli-
cations in a wide range of industries including Automotive, Aerospace, Consumer Products,
and Industrial & Research Applications. Robust Tribometers provide highly accurate and
repeatable wear and friction testing compliant with ISO and ASTM standards. This is achieved
by applying a constant load on the material to be worked through a Pin, Ball, or sample by con-
tinuous movement generated by rotation or linear to and fro motion. Depending on the envi-
ronment in which one would like to use the specimen, the tribometer can be equipped with
accessories to test the samples in various environments like liquid, high temperature, or

humidity conditions. Our instrument performs all the experiments at atmospheric conditions.
To perform the archaeological experiments, we have customized the sample holder, which
gave us the flexibility to use flint samples for the wear analysis (Fig 2). A linear reciprocating
stage, where the rotating motion of the spindle is converted to linear to and fro motion to
mimic the tribological motion of cutting, was used for all our tribology experiments. After per-
forming various controlled experiments under different loads, we set the normal load to be 20
N for tribological experiments. The reciprocating stage moved at a speed of 50 RPM (3000
strokes per hour) and an amplitude of 20 mm. We decided on 20N because it was the highest
load we could use to maintain a smooth motion. We performed the experiments at three dif-
ferent durations (one hour, three hours, and five hours) to understand the development of
wear on the different combinations of flint and worked materials (Table 1). Each experiment
collects the information of wear with respect to the reciprocating motion or time as well as the
force vs. coefficient of friction during the test. In experiments where humans conduct activities
with stone tools, the surface modification can appear as fast as 10 minutes. However, this setup
uses a load smaller than humans can produce. Hence a longer working time was necessary to
obtain a modified surface. We evaluated that one to five hours of work were required to obtain
texture modifications on the stone surface with this setup.

Sensors and calibration. Nanovea T50 has various sensors to provide accurate load and
wear information. In the T50 tribometer used in this paper, we have a LVDT/depth sensor and
a friction sensor (precision load cell). For calibration of T50, we have two different parts (Disk
Motor and Analog Sensors) where user input is needed before performing any experiment for
data collection. Disk Motor is generally not calibrated unless the software sends a prompt to

calibrate. Therefore, our focus mainly was to calibrate the Analog Sensors (primarily the load
sensor). A step-by-step procedure to calibrate the load cell is given in Fig 3. Steps 1–4 are con-
trolled by the software interface where we prepare the instrument for calibration with no hang-
ing weights on the tribometer arm. Once we get to step 5, we raise the tribometer arm. In the
following step, we set the load value to be zero. In step 7, we enter the calibration load neces-
sary for the experiment. For our case, we set 20 N as the calibration load. In Step 8, we place
the 20 N load on the calibration lanyard and place the other end over the sample holder as
shown. It is important to verify that the lanyard is horizontal between the pulley and the sam-
ple holder. Once the calibration weight stops swinging, we set the load to complete the calibra-
tion. The instrument was calibrated before every run on the archaeological samples.

Sample preparation

Flint bits. The stone was first broken into small fragments using a hammer. The flint bits
that had a flat natural surface on one side were selected. The opposite side was then adjusted to
fit into the tribometer’s clamp using a saw (Buehler, ISOMET TM, low speed saw) and then
glued (Scotch Create Permanent Super Glue Liquid) to the clamp. The flat natural surface was
rubbed against one of the worked materials selected. As surface modifications appear unevenly
on the sides of the sharp edge of a tool, this setup helps to create a sufficiently large modified
area for carrying out microscopic analyses. Samples were manipulated with gloves and were
cleaned before every documentation of wear, once to document the surface roughness before
use and once after each tribological sequence. Because of the metallic nature of the clamp, a
harsh cleaning protocol using acid and base was impossible and, instead, a mild cleaning pro-
cess was used. The samples were placed in individual plastic bags filled with a 10% neutral
soap solution (Valconox, Luminox). They were then immersed into an ultrasonic bath for 15

minutes (Branson 5800, 40 kHz, at room temperature, 22˚C). Then, they were rinsed with tap
water and put in a distilled water bath for 5 minutes. Finally, samples were left to air-dry.
Reflectance infrared spectroscopy was performed on both used and unused surfaces of the flint
bits. Results were presented in a previous study [28]. Both surfaces are composed of quartz
(crystalline silica), the main component of flint. These results confirmed that the mild cleaning
method used during the experiment successfully removed residue from the flint bits before
they were observed under a microscope.

Hardness tests for flint and target materials. The hardness of each raw material (flint
and worked materials) was measured using a nano-indentation test. The samples were placed
in resin using a SamplKwick Fast Cure Acrylic Kit 20–3560 (which contains SamplKwick Pow-
der 20–3562 and SamplKwick Liquid 20–3564). The resin was prepared by a cold molding pro-
cess done at room temperature by mixing two parts of 20–3562 SamplKwick Powder and one
part of 20–3564 SamplKwick and blending thoroughly for 15–20 seconds. Then the mixture
was poured into ring molds without delay. Before pouring the mix into the ring molds, we
sprayed the cups with mold release spray (Buehler Mold Release Spray, 203050008). Finally,
the surface of the cast was polished to obtain a smooth surface.

The nanoindentation measurements were performed using a nanoindenter (TI 950, Tri-
boindenter, Hysitron, Minneapolis, MN) equipped with a diamond Berkovitch indenter. Prior
to the experiment, the tip area function and the frame stiffness were calibrated using a fused
silica standard. Nanoindentation measurements were conducted using the Oliver-Pharr or the
quasi-static loading mode [40–42] from which the reduced modulus (Er) and hardness were
estimated (Fig 4) The initial unloading portion of the load-displacement curve represents
purely elastic recovery. The slope of this unloading segment is a measure of the material con-
tact stiffness [43]. The reduced Young’s modulus (Er) can be calculated by

ranges between 0.1–0.3, we have decided to report the Er rather than estimate the ES for modu-
lus comparison (see S1 Appendix) [45].

In addition, the hardness (H) can be calculated using the maximum load, Pmax, by

where Ac is the contact area of the indentation. These quasi-static measurements were per-
formed with a 5 s load time and a 10 s dwell time at a maximum load of 3000 μN for stones
and 300 μN for, spruce wood, beech wood, bone, ivory, and antler (Table 2).

Analysis of altered surfaces

An optical profilometer (S-Neox, Sensofar Metrology, Barcelona, Spain) was used to collect
surface topography measurements before the experimentation and then at each step of the
experiment. At each step, 3 to 5 measurements of different areas were taken for each sample
depending on the alteration development. The roughness measures correspond to the whole
field of view filled by the altered surface (as identified visually). Measurements were acquired
with both a 20× objective (TU Plan Fluor EPI P; NA = 0.45; FoV = 872.68μm × 655.965μm)
and a 50× objective (TU Plan Fluor EPI P; NA = 0.80; FoV = 350.88μm × 264.19μm). Pictures
were taken using the blue LED (530 nm) to obtain the highest resolution possible with our
equipment. Only pictures with a surface measure higher than 98% were used for the analysis.
The surface images were then analyzed using SensoMap (Standard 7.4, the equivalent of
Mountains Map designed by Digital Surf for Sensofar). To extract surface parameters from the
pictures, the filtering protocol presented in Calandra et al. [46] was used: (1) extraction of the
topographic layer, (2) use of a Gaussian low-pass S-filter (S1 nesting index = 1.093 μm for the
20× objective and 0.437 μm for the 50×, end effects managed) to remove noise and keep the
primary surface, (3) use of an F operator (polynomial of degree 3) to remove the form and
keep the SF surface, i.e., texture, (4) use of a Gaussian high-pass L-filter (L nesting
index = 327.980 μm for the 20× objective and 131.200 μm for the 50×, end effects managed) to
filter out the waviness and keep the SL surface, i.e., roughness, and (5) setting threshold surface
between 0.010 and 99.9% material ratio to remove the aberrant positive and negative spikes. It
is important to note, however, that sometimes that threshold was readjusted depending on the
persistence of the outliers. The cut-off values were calculated following ISO norms [47, 48] rec-
ommendations; the L nesting index used was half the size of the shortest side (breadth) of the
field of view, and the S1 nesting index was obtained by dividing the L nesting by 300 times.
Four of the ISO25178 parameters were selected to perform the statistical analysis (Fig 5):

arithmetic mean height (Sa), autocorrelation length (Sal), arithmetic mean peak curvature
(Spc), and the upper material ratio (Smr1). These four parameters, relatively independent, pro-
vide an overall understanding of the surface textures [49]. Moreover, a digital microscope
(DinoLite Edge 3.0 AM73515MZT) was used to document the overall bits’ surfaces after five
hours of use and pictures of the surface modifications were taken at 100X (TU Plan ELWD;
NA = 0.80) with the Sensofar S-NEOX. The residual powders formed by the friction of the
stone bit against the worked material were collected and then analyzed (imaging and EDX)
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM Hitachi S-3500N).

The statistical analyses were performed in the open-source software R (v. 3.5.2; [50] using

the following packages: ggplot2 (v. 3.1.0; [51]), dplyr (v. 0.8.0.1; [52]), tidyr (v. 0.8.3; [53]),
ggpubr (v. 0.1.2; [54]), ggalt (v. 0.4.0; [55]), MASS (v. 7.3–53.1; [56]), gridExtra (v.2.3; [57]),
cowplot (v. 1.1.1; [58]), rstatix(v. 0.7.0; [59]), and knitr (v. 1.31; [60]). Boxplots were produced
to give a sense of the flint texture variation depending on the worked material hardness.
Besides, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test were used to show which rough-
ness parameters can help discriminate material types or hardness. Finally, we ran a Kendall’s-
tau correlation test (Kendall v. 2.0 [61]) to examine the degree of correlation between the hard-
ness of the worked material and the surface texture of the worked flint bits.

Results
Direct observation results

Visually, it is noticeable that polish did not develop to the same extent on all the flint bits, as
observable at 100X magnification (Fig 6) and even with the naked eye (Fig 7). According to the
statistical results, the flint surface appears more polished when rubbed on spruce wood and
beech wood. For the other worked material, the polish is sparser.

Statistical results

The Sa parameter is the only parameter for which the analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows
statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between traces obtained with the different
worked material (Fig 8). Hence, Sa is the most suited of the four parameters tested for under-
standing the worked material hardness’s impact on the formation of surface modification. The
results indicate that surface modification on flint is influenced by the worked material, and

that material hardness plays a role in the development of surface modification. It suggests that
softer worked materials will create smoother surface modifications relative to harder materials.
Given these results, it is imperative that other mechanical properties of materials typically
expected to occur in prehistoric tasks be studied.

Paired t-tests with the Bonferroni correction results for the Sa parameter (see Table 3) show

that it is possible to differentiate a flint piece before and after use only for the softest material,
the spruce wood (p = 0.001). It is also possible to differentiate between the two wood types
(p = 0.045). However, for antler, ivory, and bone, the paired t-tests show that the means before

and after use were not significantly different. In term of duration of the action, the results were
statistically significant after 3 hours of use. However, the significance increased after 5 hours of
use in particular making it possible to distinguish between the two wood types.

The Kendall’s-tau correlation test (Table 4) shows a strong positive statistical relationship
between the hardness of the worked material and the modification of the surface texture only
for the Sa parameter. This test confirms that the harder the worked material is, the greater the
Sa value.

Track analysis

One explanation for these results could be the presence of more abrasive compounds in the
softer worked material such as silicate. Residual powders from the track formed by the flint
rubbing on the worked materials were collected and analyzed using scanning electron micros-
copy (Hitachi S-3500N) and X-ray analysis (EDS) (Fig 9). Silica could not be found in the EDS
framing the broad region of the samples, most likely because the other elements’ noise was too
heavy to enable the detection of other compounds or because the powdered silica are too small
to be picked up by the EDS probe. However, we found that the interfacial powders from each
raw material contained flint fragments of approximately 200μm.

In this case, the two softer materials happen to be wood, but silica content in temperate
wood species is negligible [62], whereas the apatite contained in the bone matrix are softer
than the quartz in flint. At the same time, because flint was found in track powders associated
with all materials, it is possible that these particles contributed most to the abrasion, since they
are hard enough to scratch the stone surface. However, we do not understand exactly how and
why flint particles were broken off the stone surface in the first place. Although we tried to
maintain a contact between two relatively flat surfaces to maximize contact area and minimize
the variation in pressure distribution, because we opted for a natural raw surface, edge break-
ages were still possible.

suggesting that the fragment (white on the picture) is a flint fragment.

PLOS ONEThe effect of worked material hardness on stone tool wear

Discussion

The basic problem in explaining what causes stone tool wear is that most worked materials
(such as skins, wood, bone, etc.) are softer than stone and cannot, in theory, abrade the stone
tools themselves. However, given that this nevertheless happens [26–28, 63], which factors
related to the target material play the most significant role? Our counterintuitive result sug-
gests that the abrasion ‘paradox’ must be explained by either the presence of hard grits within
the worked material, the presence at the interface of stone particles broken off the tool edge, or a
combination of both [64]. The role of plant silica (phytoliths) in lithic use wear formation is
still not completely understood [62], especially with respect to the different quantities present
in different wood species [65]. However, we do not have any reason to believe it played a large
role in this study, because the track powder did not contain any phytoliths, which would have
been sufficiently large to be detected with the SEM. As we found flint particles in every track’s
powder, it could be expected that they create homogeneous surface modifications. However,
our results show that modifications are not homogeneous and differ depending on the worked
material. In addition, the particles found were too big to produce the type of modification
observed in particular on the sample with less surface modifications. The last possibility is that
still finer particles are removed by contact with the wood via a combination of friction heat
and mechanical dislodging. A worked material’s ability to do that is likely determined by its
own structure and mechanical properties. Therefore, knowing exactly to which degree these
properties are responsible for creating wear is crucial for being able to recognize different
worked materials.

The results obtained in this study confirm previous results stating that it is possible to dif-
ferentiate between the softest material (woods) and harder ones (referred as ABI: antler, bone,
ivory) statistically. It is nonetheless important to note the statistical separation between the
two types of wood, spruce (softer) and beech (harder). While wood is sometimes described as
softer than antler ivory or bones, wood hardness depends on the wood species and the fresh-
ness of the wood. In our study the beech wood was closer in terms of hardness to ABI and not
statistically different from them. Using basic surface topography, it does not seem possible to
distinguish among antler, bone, ivory and beech wood. These observations confirm previously
reported difficulties in visually differentiating surface modifications within this group, which
are often reported together as ABI [66, 67].

An unresolved issue is that, even after 5 hours of work in our setup, harder materials cre-
ated barely developed any surface modifications, while the wood samples abraded the stone
surfaces almost completely smooth. Hence, for ivory, bone, and antler, it was impossible to dis-
tinguish the before and after use surfaces based on changes in Sa. In our previous work scrap-
ing beech wood [68], quantifiable differences in Sa were only documented with higher loads,
of 90N and 100N. These loads were compatible with measurements we took during tasks con-
ducted by humans in the lab [69]. However, here we were able to obtain changes in Sa for the
same material, beech wood, even with the comparatively much lower load of 20N. The discrep-
ancy can be attributed to the difference in the ability of that paper’s instrument (using focus
variation) to measure surface modification and/or, given other teams’ successes using focus
variation [11], to the lack of a standardized surface on which to measure it. As shown by Pfle-
ging et al. [68], these new results confirm that load is not the factor contributing the most
information to stone surface modification as it is possible to obtain an extended smoothing of
the surface with a low load. However, it is also possible that with small loads much longer
working durations are required to make noticeable changes to the stone surface. This could be
due to other factors involved in the surface modifications, such as processes involving dislodg-
ing particles from the stone surface using friction heat. Natural lubricants in the worked

material (e.g., grease in bone, water), the presence of abrasive particles such as the stone parti-
cles found in the residues, and mineral content of the worked material may also contribute to
the modification of flint surfaces.

Finally, in addition to hardness, other factors, such as elasticity, fracture toughness, etc. can
impact surface modification and polish formation and remain to be documented experimen-
tally in future studies.

Conclusion

As discussed in another paper related to this experimental setup [28], in this experiment polish
is formed by the abrasion of the flint surface. Consequently, we expect that harder worked
materials would be more effective at creating surface modifications. However, our experiment
shows the softest worked materials produce the smoothest odified surfaces (i.e., the surface has
the lowest arithmetical mean height (Sa)). Given these results, it is imperative that other
mechanical properties of materials typically expected to occur in prehistoric tasks be studied.
These could include the materials’ own surface roughness, elasticity, fracture toughness, the
presence and brittleness of embedded grits, and others. In addition, longer work duration and/
or higher loads (with different machines) can be tested to obtain more greater surface modifi-
cations on stone samples used on harder materials. Additionally, for this pilot study, materials
were used in the dry condition, but saturation with water and added lubrication (e.g., fat)
should be included in future studies.
