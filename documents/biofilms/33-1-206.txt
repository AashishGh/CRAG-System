Abstract

Bioﬁlms are densely packed communities of microbial cells that grow on surfaces
and surround themselves with secreted polymers. Many bacterial species form bioﬁlms,
and their study has revealed them to be complex and diverse. The structural and
physiological complexity of bioﬁlms has led to the idea that they are coordinated and
cooperative groups, analogous to multicellular organisms. We evaluate this idea by
addressing the ﬁndings of microbiologists from the perspective of sociobiology,
including theories of collective behavior (self-organization) and social evolution. This
yields two main conclusions. First, the appearance of organization in bioﬁlms can
emerge without active coordination. That is, bioﬁlm properties such as phenotypic
differentiation, species stratiﬁcation and channel formation do not necessarily require
that cells communicate with one another using specialized signaling molecules. Second,
while local cooperation among bacteria may often occur, the evolution of cooperation
among all cells is unlikely for most bioﬁlms. Strong conﬂict can arise among multiple
species and strains in a bioﬁlm, and spontaneous mutation can generate conﬂict even
within bioﬁlms initiated by genetically identical cells. Bioﬁlms will typically result from
a balance between competition and cooperation, and we argue that understanding this
balance is central to building a complete and predictive model of bioﬁlm formation.

Introduction

Bacteria are gregarious organisms that commonly form densely
populated communities, known as bioﬁlms. These microbial
collectives, which are typically encased in secreted polymers,
occupy many biotic and abiotic surfaces and frequently contain
multiple species (Fig. 1). The ubiquity of bioﬁlms in the natural
environment, including plant and animal hosts, suggests that
living in groups is critical for bacterial ecology and evolution
(Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004). Bacterial aggregates directly impact
human lives as well. Bioﬁlm-dwelling cells appear more tolerant
to antibiotics than planktonic cells and are responsible for many
health threats, including acute and chronic infections and the
degradation of implanted prosthetic devices (Watnik & Kolter,
1999; Stewart, 2002; Mah et al., 2003; Heithoff & Mahan, 2004;
Costerton et al., 2005; Fux et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2005; Obst
et al., 2006; Manos et al., 2007). Bacterial bioﬁlms also
contaminate drinking water distribution systems and cause a
multitude of industrial problems associated with biofouling
(Jass & Walker, 2000).

The signiﬁcance of bioﬁlms for microbial ecology and
human society has motivated an enormous amount of

research on the genetic, biochemical, and physical mechan-
isms underlying bioﬁlm formation (Hall-Stoodley et al.,
2004). This work has shown that the characteristics of bioﬁlms
often differ both within and among species as culture condi-
tions change. Diverse bacterial groups form bioﬁlms with
different composition and structure (Beloin & Ghigo, 2005),
to the extent that the term bioﬁlm may sometimes be too
readily applied (Moxon et al., 2008). However, many bioﬁlms
do share common features that set them apart from popula-
tions of planktonic cells, and a growing consensus holds that
these bacterial communities are functional entities in which
cells display speciﬁc adaptations to bioﬁlm life (O’Toole et al.,
2000a; Hall-Stoodley & Stoodley, 2002; Sauer et al., 2002;
Stoodley et al., 2002; Webb et al., 2003a).

Bioﬁlm growth is usually depicted as a series of discrete
stages in a life cycle (Stoodley et al., 2002), which begins
when planktonic cells contact a surface, either randomly or
by taxis toward chemical attractants (Freter & Obrien, 1981;
Pratt & Kolter, 1998; Meibom et al., 2004). Initial attach-
ment is often reversible such that cells can depart from a
surface if conditions change. Some bacteria can also position
themselves using extracellular pilli, which act as miniature

Sociobiology of bioﬁlms

Fig. 1. Bioﬁlms often have structural features
that appear to suggest coordination or coopera-
tion among bacteria. (a) Monospecies bioﬁlms of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a subpopulation
of cells differentiating into diverse phenotypes
that lead to localized cell death (Webb et al.,
2003b). (b) Floating bioﬁlms of Bacillus subtilis
form multicellular aerial structures similar to
fruiting bodies (inset) in which cells sporulate
(Branda et al., 2001). (c) Natural bioﬁlms such as
those found on riverbeds can contain many
species (cyanobacteria in pink, green algae in
blue, EPS in green; courtesy of T. Neu). (d)
Different species in a bioﬁlm may separate into
discrete layers according to their metabolic
properties as the bioﬁlm matures (Roeselers et al.,
2008). (e, f) Evolution of species interactions
between Acinetobacter sp. C6 (red) and
Pseudomonas putida (green) in a ﬂowcell leads to
a more productive bioﬁlm; this occurs not by
mutual cooperation but by an increase in the
efﬁciency with which one species exploits the
other (Hansen et al., 2007).

grappling hooks and allow cells to move over each other
(Klausen et al., 2003a) or along a solid substrate (O’Toole &
Kolter, 1998). More stable surface attachment can be
achieved via speciﬁc adhesin molecules (Hinsa et al., 2003;
Latasa et al., 2005). For example, the opportunistic pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa binds disaccharide units within the
mucus lining of the human lung (Wilson et al., 1996), and
Vibrio cholerae attaches to chitin polymers in the exoskele-
tons of marine crustaceans (Meibom et al., 2004).

After surface attachment, bacteria grow and divide to
form the dense cell groups that characterize bioﬁlms. Micro-
array studies indicate that diverse model species – including
P. aeruginosa, V. cholerae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus

aureus – differentially express as much as 10% of their
genomes when in bioﬁlm vs. planktonic growth conditions
(Schoolnik et al., 2001; Whiteley et al., 2001; Schembri et al.,
2003; Beenken et al., 2004). As might be expected, these
altered transcriptional proﬁles are associated with phenotypic
changes in cell–cell and cell–surface adhesion, metabolism,
motility, and extracellular product secretion. However, gene
expression studies also illustrate that bioﬁlms of different
strains or species may be as different from one another as
they are from a planktonic population (Beloin & Ghigo,
2005). Individual bioﬁlms are themselves heterogeneous:
genetically identical cells in a bioﬁlm can diverge in a
wide variety of traits, including basic metabolic activity

(Xu et al., 1998), antibiotic tolerance (Balaban et al., 2004),
spore formation (Branda et al., 2001), and the secretion of
extracellular polymers (Vasseur et al., 2005; Vlamakis et al.,
2008).

Secreted polymers are a deﬁning feature of bioﬁlms. Cells
typically produce and embed themselves in a matrix of
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) composed of poly-
saccharides and smaller amounts of protein and DNA
(Beenken et al., 2004; Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004; Braxton
et al., 2005; Flemming et al., 2007). The functions of EPS are
not yet clear, but it appears to promote surface attachment
and provide structural support; mutants that cannot pro-
duce EPS are often deﬁcient in bioﬁlm formation (Davies
et al., 1993; Danese et al., 2000; Hammer & Bassler, 2003;
Kearns et al., 2005). EPS may also afford protection from
external threats, such as antimicrobial compounds and
predatory organisms (Mah & O’Toole, 2001; Stewart, 2002;
Fux et al., 2005; Matz et al., 2005), or help secreting strains
to grow toward nutrient-rich locations (Foster & Xavier,
2007; Xavier & Foster, 2007; Nadell et al., 2008). To disperse
from a bioﬁlm, however, bacteria must also be able to escape
the binding properties of EPS. Detachment can occur by
ﬂuid ﬂow shearing off cells (Telgmann et al., 2004), or by
active processes on the part of bacteria. For example,
V. cholerae cells appear to encourage dispersal by secreting
enzymes that break down the surrounding structural matrix
(Hammer & Bassler, 2003; Zhu & Mekalanos, 2003; Heithoff
& Mahan, 2004; Liu et al., 2007).

An enduring question is how bacteria regulate the changes
in gene expression underlying the changes in cell behavior that
characterize bioﬁlms. Although no single mechanism is
responsible (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004), many species use
quorum sensing to modulate surface attachment (Dunne,
2002), motility (Schuster & Greenberg, 2006), EPS production
(Davies et al., 1998; Hammer & Bassler, 2003; Sakuragi &
Kolter, 2007), and dispersal (Allison et al., 1999; Dow et al.,
2003). Quorum sensing entails the secretion and detection of
small diffusible molecules, often known as autoinducers.
Bacteria are thought to use autoinducer concentrations as a
proxy for population density and thereby tune their behavior
according to the local abundance of other cells (Miller &
Bassler, 2001; Waters & Bassler, 2005; Bassler & Losick, 2006).
It is also possible that bacteria use quorum sensing to monitor
the extent of diffusion and ﬂuid ﬂow in their local micro-
environment (Redﬁeld, 2002; Hense et al., 2007). Most species
upregulate bioﬁlm-associated behaviors at high cell density,
and some mutant strains that can no longer detect autoindu-
cers are unable to form bioﬁlms (Parsek & Greenberg, 2005).
There are interesting exceptions to this pattern, however:
V. cholerae, the pathogenic agent responsible for pandemic
cholera among humans, downregulates bioﬁlm-associated
behavior at high cell density. Mutants of this species that
cannot detect autoinducers form exceptionally large bioﬁlms

the impact of
(Hammer & Bassler, 2003). Importantly,
quorum-sensing regulation on bioﬁlm formation can depend
strongly on environmental conditions. While P. aeruginosa is
known to regulate behaviors such as EPS secretion via quorum
sensing (Davies et al., 1998; Sakuragi & Kolter, 2007), for
example, there are some culture conditions in which quorum-
sensing null mutants and wild-type bacteria produce indis-
tinguishable bioﬁlms (Purevdorj et al., 2002).

The use of quorum-sensing and environmental cues to
regulate transitions between seemingly discrete bioﬁlm life-
stages has fostered the idea that bioﬁlms emerge from a
bacterial developmental program, analogous to those of
multicellular organisms (O’Toole et al., 2000b; Danese et al.,
2001; Hall-Stoodley & Stoodley, 2002; Stoodley et al., 2002;
Webb et al., 2003a). Some have further hypothesized that
whole-group coordination – energetically costly intercellular
signaling over spatial scales much larger than that of a single
cell (Keller & Surette, 2006) – is required for the production of
the heterogeneous and apparently complex bioﬁlm structures
observed in many species (Stoodley et al., 2002). Further, a
prevailing rhetoric within the literature tends, both explicitly
and implicitly, to cast bioﬁlms as aggregates in which indivi-
dual cells cooperate with each other. It is presumed that
bioﬁlm-dwelling bacteria display altruistic behavior, decreas-
ing their own ﬁtness – that is, their reproductive output – in
order to increase the ﬁtness of other cells and thereby beneﬁt
the bioﬁlm community as a whole (Table 1).

Because of their strength in numbers, bacteria residing at
high density in bioﬁlms can achieve protection from external
threats and impact their biotic and abiotic environments
in ways that are simply impossible for individual cells
(Stewart, 2003b). Does this mean that bioﬁlms are multi-
cellular in analogy to a metazoan organism, or could it be that
bioﬁlms are merely multiorganismal, similar in principle to a

Based on Hamilton (1964). A common proxy for direct ﬁtness for many
microorganisms is their rate of cell division. For example, consider a
microorganism that secretes a costly product that beneﬁts all cells in its
neighborhood, including itself. This is an example of cooperation, and if
secreting such a product causes a net decrease in the focal cell’s growth
rate, it is also an example of altruism.
(cid:1)In our review, we deﬁne coordination as processes that rely on
cooperative signaling among cells, which is likely to involve the altruistic
production of one or more signaling molecules.

ﬂock of birds, a school of ﬁsh, or a swarm of insects? One can
evaluate this question by examining the proximate mechan-
isms that regulate bioﬁlm formation, which is the subject of
another upcoming review (Monds & O’Toole, 2008). One may
alternatively dissect the ultimate causes of bioﬁlm formation
from the perspective of evolutionary biology, which is the
purpose of our present paper. Speciﬁcally, our goal is to
critically evaluate the idea that physical and biological com-
plexity in bioﬁlms is a product of coordination and coopera-
tion among the bacteria residing within them.

Why is it important to understand whether group-living
bacteria truly cooperate with each other? We will argue that
understanding the degree to which bioﬁlms rely on coopera-
tion among their constituent cells is critical to any predictive
model of bioﬁlm formation and to the design of effective
strategies for combating bioﬁlm infections. While coordina-
tion and cooperation among bioﬁlm-dwelling bacteria are
conceivable, two branches of theory warn against assuming
that bioﬁlm complexity is evidence of a harmonious social
group. First, the theory of collective behavior shows that
apparently coordinated aggregates can emerge from the
uncoordinated activity of many individuals following sim-
ple behavioral rules (Box 1; see section ‘Bioﬁlm complexity
without coordination’). Second, evolutionary theory pre-
dicts that cooperation can only evolve under special circum-
stances (Box 2; see section ‘Competition and cooperation in
bioﬁlms’), and that competition will play a strong role
governing the behavior of most organisms living in close
proximity (Alexander, 1974). In particular, many bioﬁlms
contain multiple strains and species (Kolenbrander, 2000;
Burns et al., 2001), among which competitive interactions
are likely to be common (Hansen et al., 2007).

Biofilm complexity without coordination

Bioﬁlms are not merely a collection of cells that all behave
identically; on the contrary, bacterial groups are heteroge-
neous by most measures currently available to describe them
(Stewart & Franklin, 2008). Fluorescence microscopy reveals
that mono- and multispecies bioﬁlms contain segregated
subpopulations with different phenotypic and physiological
properties. Furthermore, bioﬁlm surfaces are often rugged
and uneven, containing large multicellular towers inter-
weaved by ﬂuid-ﬁlled channels (De Beer et al., 1994a).

Heterogeneity in physiological state and spatial structure
appears to be a fundamental feature of bioﬁlms that is
associated with their increased antibiotic tolerance and
pathogenicity (Stewart & Costerton, 2001; Stewart, 2002;
Fux et al., 2005). It has been suggested that this hetero-
geneity results from active intercellular signaling that co-
ordinates the bioﬁlm to maximize its productivity (Table 1)
(O’Toole et al., 2000b; Danese et al., 2001; Hall-Stoodley &
Stoodley, 2002; Stoodley et al., 2002; Webb et al., 2003a).
The emergence of bioﬁlm heterogeneity on its own, how-
ever, does not necessarily require cooperative, coordinated
bacterial behavior. In this section, we review evidence that
bioﬁlm composition and structure can also arise as a
consequence of bacteria simply adjusting their behavior to
the immediate surroundings and competing for limited
resources. This perspective is drawn from the study of
collective behavior in animal groups (Box 1), and the
application of computational bioﬁlm models that capture
the interaction between bacterial growth and solute gradi-
ents (Wimpenny & Colasanti, 1997; Picioreanu et al., 1998a;
Kreft et al., 2001; Xavier et al., 2005, 2007).

Box 1. Collective behavior: complex patterns
from simple rules

Spatially explicit models of bioﬁlm formation have shown
that simple cellular responses to the local environment are
sufﬁcient
to produce complex structures in bacterial
groups (Wimpenny & Colasanti, 1997; Picioreanu et al.,
1998a, 2004; Noguera et al., 1999; Dockery & Klapper,
2001; Kreft et al., 2001; Xavier et al., 2005). These ﬁndings
are mirrored in the study of animal behavior. A casual
glimpse into the natural world reveals that bacteria are not
alone in their proclivity for group living. Organisms from
every corner of the animal kingdom form aggregates, with
particularly conspicuous cases including insect swarms,
ﬁsh schools, bird ﬂocks, and mammalian herds (Sumpter,
2006). Many of these animal collectives have a physical
coherence that at ﬁrst appears to require long-range
signaling among their
constituents. Fish
schools, for example, exhibit a wide range of structures,

individual

including stationary swarms and cylindrical vortices that
rapidly change form in response to predators or prey
items.

Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that
the integrity and collective behavior of animal groups does
not always entail active communication and coordination
among constituent members (Sumpter, 2006; Couzin,
2007). Couzin et al. (2002) explored the mechanisms
underlying group structure using a model that implemen-
ted idealized swarming organisms following three simple
rules: (1) move away from neighbors that are too close, (2)
align with neighbors of intermediate distance, and (3)
avoid separation from the group. As the size of the
alignment zone increases, the group transitions from a
stationary swarm, to a doughnut-shaped group rotating
around its collective center of mass, to an aligned group in
which all individuals are traveling in the same direction.
Couzin et al. (2005) later used another model to show that
groups of moving organisms can collectively choose the

better of
two resource patches even when no single
individual has information about both feeding opportu-
nities.

Examples of apparently complex group phenomena
can thus be explained by simple behavioral rules on the
part of group members. Furthermore, individual animals
often join and participate in groups because membership
therein provides direct beneﬁts, such as increased foraging
efﬁciency and predator vigilance, an example of mutual-
ism rather than altruism (Table 1) (Krause & Ruxton,
2002). The properties of animal aggregates can even
emerge from strong conﬂicts of interest among group
members. For example, the collective behavior of desert
locust nymphs appears to be driven by cannibalism: the
group proceeds en masse because each individual attempts
to eat those in front and avoid being eaten by those behind.
This process, combined with high population density,
yields an enormous march of insects that culminates in
the notorious locust plagues of North Africa and the
Middle East (Bazazi et al., 2008).

While group structure and behavior do not strictly
require them, coordination via dedicated signaling systems

does play a critical role in the collective activity of some
species. For example, the organization of social insect
colonies emerges from a mixture of individual behavioral
decisions combined with many forms of communication
that coordinate colony activity (Bonabeau et al., 1999).
Prominent examples include the famous honeybee waggle
dance whereby experienced foragers convey the location of
ﬂowers to naı¨ve foragers, pheromone trails that lead ants
to food patches, and alarm signals that allow wasp colonies
to mount a coordinated defense against predators (Rat-
nieks & Reeve, 1992). These instances of collective beha-
vior require that individuals act in the interests of the
colony. In turn, in the absence of feedback beneﬁts, the
evolution of individually costly, group-beneﬁcial behavior
is only expected among close relatives (Table 1, Appendix
B). In general, then, the spatially and temporally complex
properties of organismal groups can be deceptive: while
whole-group coordination and cooperation do occur,
many examples of collective behavior emerge in their
absence. Care must be taken to determine which mechan-
istic and evolutionary processes are relevant to each
particular system of interest.

Diffusion limitation and chemical heterogeneity

Bacteria are often tightly packed in bioﬁlms (Stewart,
2003a). High cell density tends to reduce the bulk ﬂow of
any surrounding liquid, and diffusion governs most trans-
port of solutes between the bioﬁlm and its environment.
Diffusion is
slow compared with cellular metabolism
(Characklis, 1990), and as a result, the chemical environ-
ment within a bioﬁlm often differs greatly at different depths
(Stewart, 2003a). For example, a nutrient in the liquid
surrounding a bioﬁlm may be consumed by cells in the
outermost layers such that its concentration decreases deeper
in the bioﬁlm. Meanwhile, a product secreted by the cells in
the bioﬁlm will often accumulate to its highest concentration
within the bioﬁlm’s interior. Given that many bacteria use
multiple growth substrates and release numerous extracellu-
lar products, diffusion limitation can produce complex
vertical and transverse chemical gradients, particularly when
the secretions of some cells are consumed by others (Stewart
& Franklin, 2008). These gradients, in turn, generate numer-
ous microniches within the bioﬁlm that can induce pro-
nounced physiological heterogeneity simply because bacteria
alter their behavior according to local conditions.

A classical example of chemical and consequent physio-
logical heterogeneity is the commonly observed pattern of
oxygen depletion with increasing bioﬁlm depth, which can
occur even in small bioﬁlm clusters 40 mm deep (Kuhl et al.,
2007). Within large aerobic bioﬁlms, oxygen consumption
by bacteria in the outermost 100–200-mm cell
layer is

sufﬁcient to create anoxic environments at greater depths
(De Beer et al., 1994b). As a result, cells near the bioﬁlm
surface utilize aerobic metabolism, while cells within the
bioﬁlm must switch to anaerobic metabolism or cease
growing (Xu et al., 1998).

Biofilm growth and species segregation

Spatial heterogeneity is also common in multispecies bio-
ﬁlms, which are often stratiﬁed such that species with
different metabolic activity occupy discrete layers (Fig. 1d).
This stratiﬁcation can manifest as the separation of aerobic
and anaerobic species between the oxygenated and anoxic
regions of a bioﬁlm, or more generally as segregation of
species due to their use of different electron acceptors for
metabolism, of which oxygen is only one (van Loosdrecht
et al., 2002). For example, species stratiﬁcation is common
in the bioﬁlms of wastewater treatment reactors. Oxygen is
supplied to the reactors at low rates so that it is fully
consumed by bacteria residing at the outer surface of
bioﬁlms. These aerobes are split into several layers: species
in the outermost layer use oxygen to convert ammonium
into nitrite, and immediately below them reside other
species that aerobically oxidize nitrite to nitrate (Okabe
et al., 1999; Lydmark et al., 2006). Finally, species that
anaerobically reduce nitrate to elementary nitrogen reside
deeper in the bioﬁlm, where oxygen is no longer available.
Similar stratiﬁcation occurs in sulfate-reducing multispecies

in which bacteria reducing sulfate are found
bioﬁlms,
exclusively in the anaerobic interior (Ramsing et al., 1993).
Species segregation according to metabolic properties
might suggest that microbial consortia organize themselves
to maximize the productivity of each strain (Stoodley et al.,
2002). However, cooperation among species is only expected
under restricted conditions (Box 2), and in fact, competitive
interactions appear to drive bioﬁlm stratiﬁcation. The
metabolic separation of ammonium oxidation and nitrite
oxidation between different species probably occurs because
ammonium-oxidizing bacteria grow faster than would a
hypothetical species carrying out both steps of nitriﬁcation
within the same cell (Broda, 1977). By increasing their
growth rate in this way, ammonium-oxidizing bacteria
decrease the amount of ATP produced for each ammonia
molecule oxidized, which reduces their metabolic efﬁciency.
Therefore, the coexistence of ammonium oxidizers and nitrite
oxidizers indicates that these bacteria are selected to maximize
their own reproductive success rather than the efﬁciency of
the group in which they are living (Costa et al., 2006).

How then can one explain the organization of different
metabolic types into discrete layers? A simulation by
Picioreanu et al. (2004) showed that the differential ability
of different species to grow at different depths from the
bioﬁlm surface is sufﬁcient to explain their stratiﬁcation.
Species residing deep in sludge granule bioﬁlms grow
relatively slowly because they use nitrate as a primary
electron acceptor, which yields less energy than aerobic
metabolism. Nevertheless, they survive and dominate the
inner parts of the bioﬁlm because the species at the surface
are obligate aerobes that cannot grow where oxygen has been

depleted (de Kreuk & van Loosdrecht, 2004; Isaka et al.,
2006). That is, the segregation of metabolic types within
bioﬁlms is consistent with the classic ecological principle of
competitive exclusion, whereby competition pushes each
species, or cluster of similar species, into a discrete niche
(Scheffer & van Nes, 2006).

Biofilm surface topology

Early microscopy studies revealed that bioﬁlm surfaces vary
from smooth and conﬂuent to rough and uneven with tall
cell clusters interweaved by ﬂuid-ﬁlled channels (Costerton
et al., 1994; Klausen et al., 2003b; Wijeyekoon et al., 2004).
While one might imagine that the formation of ﬂuid-ﬁlled
channels reﬂects coordinated activity within the bioﬁlm to
improve waste removal and nutrient uptake, complex cell–
cell communication and cooperation are not necessary to
explain variability in bioﬁlm surface structure. Mathemati-
cal and computational models of bioﬁlm formation have
been developed by engineers to identify the environmental
factors that promote and inhibit bioﬁlm formation. These
models, and empirical tests, have shown that simple differ-
ences in environmental nutrient availability can account
for a variety of bioﬁlm surface structures (Wimpenny &
Colasanti, 1997; Picioreanu et al., 1998b; Dockery &
Klapper, 2001; Wijeyekoon et al., 2004).

Nutrient availability is critically important for bioﬁlm
surface structure because the outermost cells in a bioﬁlm
consume substrates diffusing in from the environment and
may thereby prevent nutrients from reaching cells residing
at greater depths (Fig. 2). The result is an outer layer of cells

Fig. 2. Computational simulations reveal that complex bioﬁlm structure can be explained by simple diffusion limitation of a growth-limiting nutrient.
(a–d) When environmental nutrient (here, oxygen) concentration is high, nutrients penetrate well into the bioﬁlm before being depleted, creating a
thick layer of actively growing cells (details in b). Bioﬁlm surface irregularities are not ampliﬁed, and the bioﬁlm remains smooth. (e–h) When
environmental nutrient concentration is low, nutrients are quickly depleted, creating a thin layer of actively growing cells (details in f). Random
irregularities in the bioﬁlm surface are ampliﬁed because cells residing in the peaks of irregularities continue to grow, while cells residing in the troughs
of irregularities cease to grow. This positive feedback process generates towers of cell clusters separated by empty channels in the absence of
intercellular communication or cooperation (h).

that typically grows much faster than the rest of the bioﬁlm
population. The thickness of this active cell layer depends
upon environmental nutrient concentrations, how quickly
nutrients diffuse into the bioﬁlm, and how quickly bacteria
consume them. When nutrients are abundant, they pene-
trate deeper into the bioﬁlm before being depleted, and the
active cell layer is thick; the bioﬁlm surface remains relatively
uniform and homogeneous because a large population of
cells at the surface is growing (Fig. 2a–d). When nutrients
are sparse, in contrast, they are more quickly depleted, and
the actively growing bioﬁlm layer is relatively thin. As a
result, irregularities in the surface of the bioﬁlm can become
greatly ampliﬁed. Speciﬁcally, if the depth of surface irregu-
larities is greater than the thickness of the actively growing
cell layer, then bacteria residing in the troughs of irregula-
rities will grow poorly, while cells at peaks of surface
irregularities retain access to nutrients and grow well. In the
absence of any sophisticated intercellular signaling, this
positive feedback process gives rise to cell towers interdigi-
tated by empty ﬂuid channels (Fig. 2e–h).

Detachment from bioﬁlms also plays an important role in
determining their surface structure. Surface erosion, caused
by predator grazing and ﬂuid ﬂow, tends to remove surface
irregularities from exposed bioﬁlm regions (Characklis
et al., 1990), particularly in long-lived bioﬁlms that have
reached a steady state through a balance between new
growth and detachment (Kwok et al., 1998). If environmen-
tal forces also cause occasional large disturbances, however,
bioﬁlms may fail to reach a steady state and instead cycle
sloughing, and regrowth
through periods of growth,
(Lewandowski et al., 2004; Xavier et al., 2005a, b). Detach-
ment may also involve active bacterial behaviors that cause
regions of the bioﬁlm to collapse or disperse, yielding
heterogeneous surface structure. For example, the soil bacter-
ium Shewanella oneidensis detaches from its bioﬁlms in
response to oxygen limitation (Thormann et al., 2005, 2006).
Some P. aeruginosa strains undergo lysis, which liqueﬁes
portions of mature bioﬁlms and releases other bacteria into
the environment. Partial bioﬁlm lysis is either prophage-
mediated (Webb et al., 2003b, 2004) or regulated by quorum
sensing (D’Argenio et al., 2002; Allesen-Holm et al., 2006).

This phenomenon may be a coordinated strategy that evolved
to allow the bioﬁlm as a whole to release cells for colonizing
new resource patches. However, the importance of competi-
tion among P. aeruginosa strains and conﬂict between lyso-
genic phage and their bacterial hosts remains to be explored
for this system.

The studies discussed thus far illustrate that, under the
inﬂuence of simple physical forces, heterogeneity in bioﬁlm
physiology and spatial structure can emerge from the
uncoordinated behavior of individual cells. However, the
absence of whole-bioﬁlm coordination does not necessarily
imply the complete absence of cooperation among group-
living bacteria (Box 1), which may take the form of other
behaviors such as restrained growth or the secretion of
shared products. Furthermore, some bioﬁlm-associated
behaviors do appear to entail
local coordination. For
example, V. cholerae uses quorum sensing to terminate
EPS secretion and upregulate secretion of extracellular
enzymes that promote dispersal en masse at high cell density
(Hammer & Bassler, 2003). Are such behaviors cooperative,
and is there evidence for whole-bioﬁlm coordination via
signaling over large spatial scales? These questions lead us
to the following section in which we evaluate the conditions
under which coordination and cooperation can evolve
among bacteria.

Competition and cooperation in biofilms

Bioﬁlm-dwelling bacteria exhibit a range of behaviors that
inﬂuence the reproduction, and thereby evolutionary ﬁt-
ness, of neighboring cells. Each of these social behaviors can
be categorized according to its ﬁtness effects on the acting
individual and on the recipient individuals (Table 1). As we
will see, focusing on ﬁtness effects allows one to identify
when natural selection will favor cooperation among bacter-
ia and perhaps coordination on the scale of whole bioﬁlms.
Recent reviews have discussed the principles of social evolu-
tion in microorganisms (Crespi, 2001; West et al., 2006,
2007; Diggle et al., 2007b; Foster et al., 2007), and here we
apply this perspective to the unique problems posed by
bacterial bioﬁlms (for another discussion, see Kreft, 2004a).

Box 2. The evolution of cooperation and
altruism: kinship, coercion, and constraint

‘If it could be proved that any part of the structure of
any one species had been formed for the exclusive
good of another species,
it would annihilate my
theory,
for such could not have been produced
through natural selection’ Darwin (1859).

The evolutionary biologist’s fascination with cooperative
and altruistic behaviors has a rich history that can be

traced back to Darwin, who discussed examples like the
sterile and seemingly selﬂess workers in social
insect
colonies and the mutualism that occurs between a nectar-
producing orchid and its insect pollinators. Speciﬁcally,
Darwin realized that natural selection should favor traits
that increase personal reproduction, and any behavior that
decreases one’s own reproduction to increase that of
another organism requires additional explanation. Over a
hundred years after On the Origin of Species was published,
William Hamilton – then only a graduate student –

developed the ﬁrst full theoretical explanation for how
cooperative behavior can evolve (Table 1). Since then, a
huge literature has developed around the problem (Leh-
mann & Keller, 2006; Gardner & Foster, 2008), but it can
be whittled down to a few central concepts:
Genetic relatedness (indirect ﬁtness):

the crux of
Hamilton’s argument was that natural selection can favor
altruistic actions (Table 1) that harm personal reproduc-
tion when they beneﬁt a family member or other indivi-
dual that shares alleles at variable loci with the actor. This
principle has far-reaching consequences for evolutionary
theory. In particular,
it predicts that cooperation and
altruism will evolve more readily in social groups contain-
ing a high proportion of genetic relatives than it will in
groups of nonkin. Accordingly, we expect cooperation to
evolve more easily in bioﬁlms that always contain a single
strain than in bioﬁlms containing multiple strains and
species, which are fraught with potential conﬂicts. While
the general effects of changing genetic relatedness in a
social group are intuitive, measuring relatedness is not.
From an evolutionary perspective, relatedness is not a
single value that exists between individuals, but rather a
conceptual tool whose calculation depends on the problem
at hand. Positive relatedness occur when two individuals
share identical alleles at a variable locus: natural selection
can only operate when there are competing alleles in the
population. Critically, relatedness should be measured at
the locus or loci that control the social behavior in
question because it is the change in frequency of alleles at
these loci that govern the evolution of each social trait.
Counterintuitively, bacterial strains that differ at a single
nucleotide position may be unrelated in the eyes of social
evolution. For example, a null mutation that eliminates
pyoverdine secretion in P. aeruginosa can produce a cheat-
ing strain that exploits any bacteria that continue to
altruistically secrete pyoverdine. This consideration is
particularly important for bioﬁlms, which endure for
many bacterial generations such that groups of initially
clonal cells may be subject to exploitation by spontaneous
mutants that no longer share the evolutionary interests of
others in the bioﬁlm.

Personal reproductive beneﬁts (direct ﬁtness): as cap-
tured in Darwin’s quote, altruism in the strict sense –
which lowers an individual’s personal reproductive ﬁtness
– cannot be favored by natural selection if it occurs
between unrelated individuals or different species. How-

ever, cooperation for mutual beneﬁt, which is distinct
from altruism, can evolve among unrelated individuals
(Table 1). Many explanations for the evolution of coop-
erative behavior in social groups, therefore, identify con-
ditions under which cooperating with others carries
personal beneﬁts that render it mutualistic. Most simply,
cooperation can emerge as a byproduct of a selﬁsh action,
as may occur when the waste product of one bacterial
species can be metabolized by another. Such byproduct
effects may turn out to be common among some bacteria
within bioﬁlms (Williams & Lenton, 2008). However, the
beneﬁts of byproduct mutualism are probably not sufﬁ-
cient to ameliorate all conﬂicts among all strains and
species living together in a group. Species living in tight
association within a bioﬁlm will often compete for limited
resources – be it nutrients or space – such that the
optimum frequency of one species for the other will be
different for each (Foster & Wenseleers, 2006). This may
mean that one species evolves to become a strong parasite
on the other, as occurs in mixed-species bioﬁlms of
Acinetobacter sp. C6 and Pseudomonas putida (Hansen
et al., 2007).

Even when species engage in mutualism, one may
expect conﬂicts whose resolution will, in turn, depend on
the ability of each species to coerce the other to its
advantage. Equally important are constraints, physiological
and otherwise, that prevent attempts of coercion from
generating an ongoing arm’s race that destabilizes the
mutualism. Stable mutualisms may often involve species
with pleiotropic constraints that link genes for cooperation
to personal beneﬁts, such that inactivating a gene for social
behavior carries a net ﬁtness cost (Foster et al., 2004, 2007).
One example is the mutualism in which Vibrio ﬁsheri
bioluminesces within the bobtail squid Euphrymna sco-
lopes. The bacteria gain a comfortable living environment
in exchange for their light production, which may render it
more difﬁcult for other species to pick out the host squid
against a reﬂective ocean surface background. Because light
production carries an energetic cost, it is predicted that V.
ﬁsheri strains with null mutations in the lux genes control-
ling bioluminescence should outgrow light-producing cells
within their squid hosts. However, the squid’s specialized
light-organ that houses its bacterial symbionts is main-
tained such that bioluminescence null mutants tend to fair
poorly in competition with light-producing cells (Visick
et al., 2000).

Growth rate

Like all other organisms, bacteria can affect each other’s
reproduction simply by using shared and limiting resources.

By dividing rapidly, a cell line can obtain a larger share of
such resources and reduce nutrient availability for other
members of the population. Rapid growers deplete nutrient
pools not only because they grow more quickly but also
because they tend to grow inefﬁciently, yielding less biomass

per unit nutrient consumed. Somewhat paradoxically, then,
fast growth may decrease a bioﬁlm’s total productivity due
to a trade-off between growing quickly (beneﬁting oneself)
and growing efﬁciently (beneﬁting the group).

The switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism is
an illustrative example of the growth rate vs. yield trade-off.
Fermentation is a form of anaerobic metabolism that allows
cells to grow quickly but at low efﬁciency (Pfeiffer, 2001;
Pfeiffer & Schuster, 2005). In mixed competition between
fermentative cells and aerobic cells, evolutionary theory
predicts that fermentation may win out simply because it
permits rapid growth while decreasing nutrient availability
for all other cells in the population. To our knowledge, this
prediction has not been directly tested in bacterial bioﬁlms,
but an experiment with the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae conﬁrmed that a fermenting strain could out-
compete aerobic strains under competition for limited
nutrients (MacLean & Gudelj, 2006).

Thus, the frequent use of anaerobic respiration in bioﬁlms
may be a signature not only of anoxic conditions but also of
conﬂict between bacteria. Kreft studied this question with an
individual-based bioﬁlm simulation and examined competi-
tion between a strain that grows rapidly but wastefully and a
second strain that grows slowly but efﬁciently (Kreft, 2004b).
The model predicted that the slow-growing high-yield strain
could outcompete the fast-growing low-yield strain, but only
when bioﬁlms were seeded by a single cell. In the vernacular
of social evolution theory, slow-growing high-yield cells
are altruists that cooperate with their neighbors by using
resources conservatively, increasing nutrient availability for
other cells, and allowing the bioﬁlm as a whole to achieve

greater biomass production (Table 1). Bioﬁlms composed
solely of slow-growing high-yield cells produce more biomass
than bioﬁlms composed solely of fast-growing low-yield cells,
but fast-growing cells fare better in direct competition with
slow-growing cells within a single bioﬁlm.

Kreft’s study illustrates a classic result in sociobiology:
altruistic behavior can be successful, but only when it is
preferentially directed toward other altruists. Otherwise,
exploitative individuals can reap the beneﬁts afforded by
altruistic individuals and outgrow them (Box 2, Fig. 3). If
altruism is directed toward clones or close relatives, which
are more likely than average to share the genes driving the
altruistic phenotype, then such genes can increase in fre-
quency in a population (Hamilton, 1964). Natural selection
is blind to which individual cells pass on a given set of genes,
so long as those genes are replicated and their information
content preserved over time. Under some circumstances, a
cell’s best strategy with respect to its genetic heritage may be to
sacriﬁce itself while beneﬁting other cells that are genetically
identical. Thus, the probability that altruists beneﬁt others
with which they share genes is a critical variable controlling
the evolution of social behavior. This probability is typically
measured as genetic relatedness, where high relatedness more
strongly favors the evolution of cooperation and altruism. In
bioﬁlms seeded by multiple strains and species, most cells in
the bioﬁlm will be genetically different, and slow-growing
high-yield strains are open to exploitation by fast-growing
low-yield strains. On the other hand, when bioﬁlms are seeded
by a single cell, relatedness among cells will be maximal, and
altruistic strategies that maximize bioﬁlm productivity are
more likely to evolve (Wilson, 1975; Foster, 2004).

Fig. 3. The evolution of selﬁshness or altruism in
mixed populations. (a) In mixed populations,
individuals that pay a cost to secrete a diffusible
public good can be exploited by neighbors that
do not secrete public goods and thereby grow
faster. (b) Spatial structure: even if altruistic cells
direct public goods indiscriminately to nearest
neighbors, the beneﬁts to clonemates can be
high if for any reason a population is structured
such that cells of the same genotype tend to be
close to each other. (c) Discrimination: altruism
can evolve in well-mixed populations when cells
produce public goods that can only be utilized by
other cells of the same genotype.

215

Diffusible secreted products

Bioﬁlms comprise not only bacterial cells but also a myriad
of compounds that the cells release into their surrounding
these compounds are diffusible
environment. Many of
substances, including digestive enzymes and chelating com-
pounds that aid nutrient acquisition. When these secreted
products are costly to synthesize but beneﬁt other cells in the
population, they are termed ‘public goods’ (West et al.,
2006). As for restrained growth, evolutionary theory pre-
dicts that public good production will be favored when its
beneﬁts can be directed toward relatives or clonemates
(Fig. 3). In mixed populations, therefore, cells that exploit
public goods without investing in them may be able to
outcompete public good-producing cells. Grifﬁn et al.
(2004) conﬁrmed this simple prediction using competition
experiments with P. aeruginosa, which can grow in iron-
limited environments by secreting pyoverdine, an iron-
scavenging siderophore. Pyoverdine synthesis is costly, and
mutants that do not produce it grow faster than wild type in
rich media. In iron-limited media, such mutants dominate
mixed cultures by exploiting the pyoverdine secreted by
wild-type cells. When growing alone in iron-limited media,
however, wild type is far superior to the pyoverdine mutant.
The release of autoinducers by quorum-sensing bacteria
may represent another example of bacterial altruism that
provides information for the good of a group, while impos-
ing direct costs on cells that secrete autoinducers (Table 1).
However, some quorum-sensing systems may instead be
driven by the release of cellular waste products rather than
dedicated signaling molecules (Miller & Bassler, 2001;
Waters & Bassler, 2005; Bassler & Losick, 2006). For exam-
ple, many species, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative,
possess protein machinery required for responding to auto-
inducer 2 (AI-2); this autoinducer molecule is a waste
product that results from the degradation of a key metabo-
lite, S-adenosylhomocysteine (Vendeville et al., 2005). In
this case, autoinducer secretion may be tantamount to
excretion, and cells are probably not releasing AI-2 to
communicate and coordinate their activity with other
members of the population (Keller & Surette, 2006). A
convincing case for an active coordination system in a
bioﬁlm, therefore, requires evidence that cells secrete an
autoinducer speciﬁcally to elicit a cooperative response from
other members of the population, rather than merely to
unburden themselves of waste material (Keller & Surette,
2006; Diggle et al., 2007b). In our experience, many ﬁnd it
unnecessary to distinguish between communication by
active signaling vs. eavesdropping on a waste product, at
least on ﬁrst thought. However, the difference is critical for
understanding whether a bacterial aggregate is behaving
as a coordinated group, like a multicellular organism, as
opposed to a collection of independent individuals. If a

given quorum-sensing system evolved to beneﬁt a group of
bacteria, it would suggest that bioﬁlms formed by the species
in question are highly cooperative at the spatial scale over
which signaling occurs and, accordingly, that this intercel-
lular communication may involve dedicated regulatory
systems that are good targets for bioﬁlm control strategies.

How can one recognize when autoinducer production has
evolved, at least in part, to elicit responses from other cells
and perhaps to coordinate group activity? One potential
indicator is an energetic cost accompanying autoinducer
production and secretion. Unless waste product secretions
serendipitously possess optimal properties for intercellular
communication, natural selection for communication among
cells is expected to generate new signal production pathways
– or modify existing waste secretion pathways – such that
energetic investment is required on the part of secreting
cells. Moreover, such signaling costs imply altruism in a
group of many cells because little or none of the beneﬁt of
releasing a signaling molecule may return to the secreting
cell (Table 1).

Identifying any costs of quorum sensing is likely to be
challenging when intercellular signaling has evolved via
modiﬁcation of a waste product excretion pathway, as may
have occurred for acyl homoserine lactone autoinducers.
Nevertheless, a cost to autoinducer production was recently
demonstrated in P. aeruginosa; wild-type cells that express
the autoinducer synthase lasI are outcompeted in mixed
culture by lasI null mutants that exploit the autoinducer
molecules released by others (Diggle et al., 2007a). In this
example, responding to autoinducer concentrations also
entails a cost:
lasR mutants, which do not possess the
receptor required for responding to the lasI autoinducer
product, outcompete wild type in mixed planktonic culture
(D’Argenio et al., 2007; Sandoz et al., 2007). Wild-type
P. aeruginosa upregulates many costly social behaviors,
including the production of siderophores and several extra-
cellular digestive enzymes, in response to high autoinducer
concentration. Like the pyoverdine-exploiting strain dis-
cussed above, lasR mutants fail to invest in the production
of extracellular public goods, including proteases that are
required for growth in media supplied only with protein
substrates.

in shaken or standing liquid media are more mobile and
therefore more likely to experience identical conditions than
cells in a bioﬁlm environment, which move less and
experience different microhabitats. This difference between
growth conditions in planktonic vs. bioﬁlm culture may
have important consequences for the outcome of social
evolution; nevertheless, the study of planktonic cells illus-
trates that simple changes in strain mixture can strongly
favor (clonal culture) or disfavor (mixed culture) the evolu-
tion and maintenance of public good secretion.

These results may have implications for bacterial patho-
genesis because many extracellular public goods, including
extracellular proteases and iron-chelating siderophores, are
virulence factors used by pathogens to exploit their host
environment and establish infections (Arvidson, 2000; Visca
et al., 2007). Indeed, understanding whether bioﬁlms and
their associated pathogenesis are a product of competition
or cooperation among their constituent cells is central to
predicting how strain diversity in a bioﬁlm will affect its
virulence. When virulence is the outcome of competition
among multiple strains and species within a host, minimiz-
ing the diversity of microorganisms contributing to infec-
tion will more effectively mitigate their effect on host
organisms. However, when virulence is the outcome of
cooperation among bacteria, promoting
competition
among strains and species – for example, by the introduc-
tion of probiotics – will tend to decrease the severity of
infections (Brown et al., 2002).

Extracellular polymeric substances

EPS production is a common bacterial behavior that lends
bioﬁlms their sticky or slimy nature. EPS may sometimes be
a shared beneﬁcial substance that protects bioﬁlms from
external threats, such as antibiotic compounds (Mah &
O’Toole, 2001), predator grazing (Matz et al., 2005), and
cells of host immune systems (Vuong et al., 2004). In many
cases, EPS is also important for the structural integrity of
bioﬁlms, and EPS null mutants tend to be deﬁcient at
bioﬁlm formation (Danese et al., 2000; Hammer & Bassler,
2003; Rainey & Rainey, 2003; Kearns et al., 2005). Speciﬁ-
cally, bacteria that do not secrete EPS often cannot bind
together efﬁciently and fail to attach to hard surfaces or to
aggregate on liquid–air interfaces (Friedman & Kolter,
2004). When grown in beakers partly ﬁlled with liquid
medium, EPS-secreting cells of Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens
cooperate to form a mat at the liquid–air interface, which
affords better access to oxygen relative to the planktonic
phase below. However, null EPS synthase mutants can
exploit the collective support of wild-type cells without
paying the cost of EPS secretion, which eventually compro-
mises bioﬁlm structure and sends the whole mat into the
anoxic liquid phase below (Rainey & Rainey, 2003).

While EPS secretion may sometimes reﬂect cooperation
among bioﬁlm-dwelling bacteria, indirect evidence suggests
that EPS can also mediate competition in bioﬁlms. Vibrio
cholerae mutants with high constitutive EPS expression
rapidly dominate solid-surface bioﬁlms in which they are
coinoculated with a strain that produces little or no EPS
(Hammer & Bassler, 2003), and hypermucoid P. aeruginosa
mutants that produce copious EPS consistently evolve and
invade chronic bioﬁlm lung infections suffered by cystic
ﬁbrosis patients (Martin et al., 1993; Govan & Deretic,
1996). Might EPS production provide a competitive edge
in bioﬁlms?

A recent individual-based simulation predicted that EPS
secretion allows a cell lineage to push its descendents up to
the oxygen-rich bioﬁlm surface while simultaneously suffo-
cating any neighboring cells that do not secrete EPS (Xavier
& Foster, 2007). This putative advantage of secreting EPS,
however, is only obtained when different strains of bacteria
compete within the same bioﬁlm. When bioﬁlms are clonal
and natural selection favors behaviors that maximize whole-
bioﬁlm productivity, excessive EPS secretion may be
disfavored because it decreases the yield of biomass per unit
nutrient consumed (Xavier & Foster, 2007) and may gen-
erate other negative effects (e.g. overproduction of EPS
predisposes bioﬁlms to sloughing and lysis in Vibrio vulni-
ﬁcus, McDougald et al., 2006). For EPS-secreting bacterial
lineages to outcompete other strains, the bioﬁlms in which
they reside together must persist
for several bacterial
generations: daughter cells of EPS-secreting strains can then
locations and increased
beneﬁt
nutrient availability afforded by the EPS secretion of parent
cells. Because the beneﬁts of EPS secretion are delayed
by multiple generations, natural selection may also favor
the use of quorum sensing to downregulate EPS secretion at
high cell density and redirect resources from EPS secretion
into growth before detachment (Pesci et al., 1997; Hammer
& Bassler, 2003; Nadell et al., 2008). Vibrio cholerae appears
to use this strategy to disperse from its host’s intestinal
environment (Hammer & Bassler, 2003; Zhu & Mekalanos,
2003; Liu et al., 2007).

Genetic exchange in biofilms

The closely packed environment in bioﬁlms makes them
ideal candidates for genetic exchange among cells (Sørensen
et al., 2005), and in fact some conjugative plasmids appear
to carry genes that promote bioﬁlm formation (Ghigo,
2001). Vibrio cholerae becomes naturally competent
in
bioﬁlms growing on chitin (Meibom et al., 2005), and the
gene encoding cholera toxin, a key virulence factor in
is transferred among cells by phage
cholera infections,
(Waldor & Mekalanos, 1996). Under low-nutrient condi-
tions, the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis also

becomes naturally competent via a set of processes that pull
DNA into the cell (Chen et al., 2006) and activate genes
responsible for homologous recombination (Dubnau et al.,
1973). Bacillus subtilis may have evolved this competence
response to ﬁsh for DNA released from other cells; whether
the goal is to gain new adaptive traits, to repair damaged
genes, to acquire nutrients, or to perform another unknown
function remains to be seen.

DNA release and the activation of natural competence
within bioﬁlms suggest that genetic exchange may be an
important facet of bacterial group living. How could DNA
swapping inﬂuence the evolution of cooperation among
microorganisms? In some cases, genetic exchange may pro-
mote cooperation among cells. For example, when genes for
cooperative secreted products are carried by mobile genetic
elements, such as plasmids or lysogenic viruses (Waldor &
Mekalanos, 1996), DNA exchange between bacteria via con-
jugation or transduction can increase the frequency of co-
operative cells in a population (Smith, 2001). However, gene
transfer may also involve conﬂict. Natural competence in
Streptococcus species, for example, occurs alongside the activa-
tion of multiple toxin–antitoxin systems that selectively lyse
surrounding cells that are not competent (Claverys &
H˚avarstein, 2007; Claverys et al., 2007). Indeed, conﬂict can
occur at an even lower level of organization if mobile genetic
elements replicate at the expense of cells in which they reside
(Paulsson, 2002). Recent evidence suggests that some trans-
posons may replicate so quickly relative to their hosts that
they can drive whole bacterial lineages extinct (Wagner, 2006).

Differentiation and development in biofilms

We have discussed evidence that bacteria slow their growth
to use resources efﬁciently and secrete molecules that beneﬁt
other cells in their surroundings. These cooperative beha-
viors are often regulated by costly quorum-sensing systems
that may reﬂect communication and coordination, at least
on the spatial scale of a few cell lengths. Although impressive
for organisms that were once considered largely solitary,
these examples still do not approach the sophistication of a
multicellular animal or plant,
in which many types of
differentiated cells communicate across the whole organism
to produce a highly integrated functional unit. Do bacterial
aggregates ever reach comparable sophistication? Coordi-
nated phenotypic diversiﬁcation may carry advantages for
bacterial groups, including insurance against uncertainty of
future environmental conditions (Kussell & Leibler, 2005),
or a division of labor in which cells specialize on single tasks
to increase the entire group’s productivity (Michod & Roze,
2001). Is there evidence that bacterial differentiation repre-
sents an adaptation for the beneﬁt of whole bioﬁlms?

One example of bacterial differentiation that may repre-
sent both a division of labor and insurance against environ-

mental uncertainty is the formation of dormant persister
cells. Subpopulations of persister cells have been observed in
planktonic cultures and within the bioﬁlms of pathogenic
bacteria (Brooun et al., 2000; Spoering & Lewis, 2001).
Persister cells are immune to many antibiotics and are
thought to protect a cell lineage from large-scale distur-
bances that induce mortality in the growing population
(Lewis, 2007). Theoretical work suggests that persister
formation requires a degree of global cooperation because
rapidly dividing strains that do not differentiate into persis-
ters can readily replace strains that curtail growth in favor of
stress tolerance (Gardner, 2007). A related ﬁnding from
P. aeruginosa is the observation that several phenotypically
distinct lineages often arise from a single clone during
bioﬁlm formation (Boles et al., 2004). These diverse pheno-
types are heritable, and their appearance depends on the
expression of RecA, a DNA repair enzyme that catalyzes
recombination. In addition, the P. aeruginosa variants that
emerge during bioﬁlm growth appear to be functionally
specialized for either dispersal or accelerated bioﬁlm forma-
tion. Importantly, some variants are more resistant to
oxidative stress and can thus protect a cell lineage from
large-scale disturbances that induce mortality in the grow-
ing population.

A second example of cell differentiation found within
P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms may also represent a division of labor
(Klausen et al., 2003a). Under some conditions, surface-
attached cells migrate by twitching motility to form clusters
and then mushroom-shaped microcolonies. These mush-
rooms appear to be structurally reinforced by extracellular
DNA, which is putatively released by quorum-sensing-
mediated autolysis of a subpopulation of cells (Allesen-
Holm et al., 2006). Meanwhile, another subpopulation in
the cap of the mushroom expresses the pmr operon in
response to some antimicrobials, which increases their stress
tolerance via cell wall modiﬁcations (Haagensen et al.,
2007). Of course, this apparent division of labor occurs in
the presence of steep chemical gradients that may induce
cells to activate different metabolic pathways (see section
‘Bioﬁlm complexity without coordination’, Pamp et al.,
2008). More work is required to determine whether differ-
entiation by P. aeruginosa is an example of global coordina-
tion or another instance of cells simply optimizing their
behavior to local conditions.

Among bacteria observed thus far, arguably the most
complex social behaviors occur in two spore-forming spe-
cies: B. subtilis and Myxococcus xanthus. Aggregation by
these species comes closest to multicellular development:
sporulation in both results from a series of temporally
separated checkpoints that produce a predictable, direc-
tional sequence of differentiation events (Monds & O’Toole,
2008). Bacillus subtilis also provides a dramatic example of
bacterial differentiation; populations of a single strain

display bimodal distributions for multiple phenotypes, in-
cluding competence, chaining (Losick & Desplan, 2008),
motility (Kearns et al., 2004), EPS production (Vlamakis
et al., 2008), and spore formation (Branda et al., 2001). A
subpopulation of cells in wild B. subtilis bioﬁlms produces
spores in small fruiting body structures that develop at the
tips of bioﬁlm surface irregularities. Larger groups of spores
are formed by M. xanthus, in which starving cells aggregate
to form a fruiting body whose cell density approaches that of
many bioﬁlms (Julien et al., 2000). It is also striking that in
both species spore-destined cells kill other members of the
population during fruiting body formation (Wireman &
Dworkin, 1977; Gonzalez-Pastor et al., 2003). In B. subtilis,
cell death releases nutrients that increase the viability of the
remaining population, allowing it to delay commitment to
sporulation (Gonzalez-Pastor et al., 2003). This violent
ending might therefore represent altruistic sacriﬁce by cells
that lyse, similar to programmed cell death within a devel-
oping multicellular organism. Alternatively, cell death in
B. subtilis and M. xanthus bioﬁlms may be the signature of
strong evolutionary conﬂict in which different strains com-
pete to become spores. Consistent with this latter interpre-
tation, different environmental M. xanthus strains can
exploit and poison one another (Fiegna & Velicer, 2005),
and toxin secretion is a well-known strategy that bacteria use
to compete with other strains and species (Durrett & Levin,
1997; Cascales et al., 2007).

Future work

Our perspective highlights four major questions that will
help us to better understand and predict the behavior of
bacteria in bioﬁlms.

Function: what are the constituent genes and
phenotypes that define the biofilm?

Before studying bioﬁlm-associated behaviors, one must
obviously identify them. Our understanding of bioﬁlms will
continue to rely on microbial genetics, which dissects
bioﬁlms into discrete behaviors and the genes that control
them (Stoodley et al., 2002; Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004; Beloin
& Ghigo, 2005). Genetic manipulation is critical for identi-
fying traits associated with bioﬁlm formation, such as the
synthesis of adhesion factors and extracellular products, and
for uncovering their relationship with the virulence and
antibiotic tolerance of pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial genet-
ics also reveals the mechanisms by which bioﬁlm-associated
behaviors are regulated, which partially determine whether
it is appropriate to draw comparisons between bioﬁlm
growth and multicellular development. For example, the
discovery of hierarchically ordered gene expression circuits
that direct a series of irreversible bioﬁlm growth steps might
reﬂect a system of cooperative and coordinated compo-

nents, comparable to a metazoan zygote (Monds & O’Toole,
2008). Finally, only by ﬁnding the genes that drive bioﬁlm
formation can one assess the evolutionary forces acting
upon bioﬁlms through the comparison of sequence varia-
tion within and between species (Smith et al., 2005).

Coordination: are biofilms orchestrated
communities?

We have seen that complex bioﬁlm structures may arise
from the uncoordinated behavior of many cells responding
to variable microenvironments. This observation, in turn,
suggests that any explanation of bioﬁlm structure that
assumes whole-bioﬁlm coordination must be tested against
the more parsimonious hypothesis that bioﬁlm structure
does not strictly depend on intercellular communication.
Comparing alternative models of bioﬁlm formation will
beneﬁt from a close interaction between laboratory experi-
ments and theoretical approaches that allow rapid in silico
manipulation of bacterial behaviors and environmental
conditions. Such an interaction between theory and experi-
ment may be helped by recent microﬂuidic chamber techni-
ques, with which nutrient gradients and the density and
position of bacteria can be manipulated at a high spatial
resolution (Keymer et al., 2006). How can these techniques
be used to identify instances of coordination among bacter-
ia? A promising direction is to further explore examples,
such as B. subtilis competence, in which differentiation into
multiple cell types occurs in the absence of nutrient gradi-
ents but does require quorum-sensing systems and high
population density (Dubau & Losick, 2006). Another en-
during question concerns how bioﬁlms achieve stability in
the face of disturbances, such as physical trauma or anti-
microbial treatment. Do the robustness and adaptability of
bioﬁlms rest upon coordination and cooperation among
bacteria, or can they arise among cells that are merely
competing to grow as quickly as possible (Bonabeau et al.,
1999)?

Cooperation: what are the costs and benefits of
biofilm-associated behaviors?

Understanding the evolution of bioﬁlm-associated beha-
viors requires that we identify which cells are affected by
each behavior. The two key questions are (1) what are the
costs and beneﬁts of a behavior to the cell that expresses it
and (2) what are the costs and beneﬁts of a behavior to cells
other than the individual that expresses it? Answering these
questions will require bioﬁlm competition experiments with
isogenic strains that differ only at the loci controlling a social
behavior of
interest. Focusing on one or a few social
behaviors at a time – and on all parties affected by each
social behavior – is required to determine whether such
the evolution of cooperation
behaviors truly represent

(Table 1; Box 2). On the other hand, mixed-species bioﬁlm
observations can be difﬁcult to interpret. Showing that
a two-species bioﬁlm is more than twice as productive
as either of the corresponding one-species bioﬁlms, for
example, does not prove mutual cooperation; it may instead
reﬂect exploitation of one species by the other (Hansen
et al., 2007). Assessing the costs and beneﬁts of quorum-
sensing and bioﬁlm-associated behaviors will also inform
our distinction between uncoordinated and coordinated
bacterial aggregates, for which the difference between eaves-
dropping and altruistic signaling is so important. Under-
standing the ﬁtness effects of bioﬁlm-associated behaviors
may also reveal the Achilles heel of pathogenic species,
which often rely on secreted enzymes and nutrient-seques-
tering compounds for their virulence. Theory predicts that
altruistic traits will be the most unstable to social manipula-
tions, such as the introduction of probiotic bacterial species
in the digestive tract (Saxelin et al., 2005).

Ecology: which strains and species are in the
biofilm, and how are they arranged?

A better understanding of the natural ecology of bioﬁlms is
required to assess how the costs and beneﬁts of bacterial
behaviors measured in the laboratory translate into ﬁtness
effects. A ﬁrst step is to identify all the species and strains
within natural bioﬁlms,
for which culture-independent
techniques such as phylochips (DeSantis et al., 2007) and
high-throughput sequencing show promise. Such coarse-
grained diversity measurements provide a useful ﬁrst proxy
of the potential for cooperation within bacterial groups: the
higher the proportion of a single strain within a bioﬁlm, the
more likely cooperative behavior can evolve and remain
stable against exploitative mutants. Assaying diversity across
time and space is also important, however, because strong
initial competition may whittle down an initially diverse
bioﬁlm to a few species that then cooperate (Cascales et al.,
2007). In addition, cell
lineages may partially segregate
within bioﬁlms simply because cell division and limited
movement tend to produce clonal clusters (Kreft, 2004b;
Xavier & Foster, 2007). Under such conditions, the evolu-
tion of public good secretion may occur more easily and
remain more stable than in mixed culture, where coopera-
tive cells are readily susceptible to exploitation (Grifﬁn et al.,
2004; Diggle et al., 2007a; Sandoz et al., 2007).

Conclusion

The ecological success of bioﬁlms is underlined by their
resilience in the face of numerous challenges, be they the
shear forces of a river current or the roaming macrophages
of a host’s immune system. It is not yet clear whether
bioﬁlms’ structural properties and capacity for perseverance
rely on organization and harmony among the cells that

reside in them. While some bioﬁlms may contain differen-
tiated cells that work in concert, many are likely to be
dominated by bacteria that simply compete to gather
limited resources and to divide as rapidly as possible.
Understanding the extent of coordination and cooperation
in bioﬁlms is paramount to building a complete picture of
how bioﬁlms form and how to manipulate them. While
bioﬁlms are a highly visible hallmark of bacteria sociality,
the application of concepts from sociobiology to bioﬁlm
research is only now beginning.
