Abstract

Many bacteria can exist as surface-attached aggregations known as biofilms. Presented in this unit 
are several approaches for the study of these communities. The focus here is on static biofilm 
systems, which are particularly useful for examination of the early stages of biofilm formation, 
including initial adherence to the surface and microcolony formation. Furthermore, most of the 
techniques presented are easily adapted to the study of biofilms under a variety of conditions and 
are suitable for either small- or relatively large-scale studies. Unlike assays involving continuous-
flow systems, the static biofilm assays described here require very little specialized equipment and 
are relatively simple to execute. In addition, these static biofilm systems allow analysis of biofilm 
formation with a variety of readouts, including microscopy of live cells, macroscopic visualization 
of stained bacteria, and viability counts. Used individually or in combination, these assays provide 
useful means for the study of biofilms.

There are a variety of systems available for examining the formation of bacterial biofilms. In 
this unit, several approaches are described that are useful for studying, in particular, the 
earlier stages of formation of these communities. Static biofilm systems may be preferable 
to chemostat or continuous-flow methods for a number of reasons. First, static assays are 
particularly useful for examining early events in biofilm formation, in some cases detecting 
biofilm formation in <60 min. For example, these assays can be used to identify signals that 
modulate the transition from a planktonic to a biofilm mode of existence. A second major 
advantage of these systems is the simplicity of the protocols: these assays can be executed 
primarily using common laboratory equipment. Furthermore, several of the assays outlined 
below have a relatively high throughput and can easily be adapted to study a variety of 
biofilm formation conditions, making them excellent tools for performing genetic screens.

Such assays can also be adapted to screen for small molecules that modulate biofilm 
formation (Junker and Clardy, 2007). In addition, simple changes in the configurations of 
these screens (e.g., media used, medium replacement regimens, incubation time, washing 
vigor) allow examination of different aspects of these bacterial communities, such as 
formation or dispersal.

The static nature of these systems does have some drawbacks. Because most of the cultures 
are neither continuously supplied with fresh medium nor aerated, there may be limitation of 
nutrients, and an inability to easily generate mature biofilms may be encountered. 
Continuous-flow and chemostat systems for the production of mature biofilms are described 
in other units in this chapter, and can address these limitations.

Presented in this unit are four basic protocols for the growth and analysis of biofilms in 
static systems. The microtiter plate biofilm assay (see Basic Protocol 1) is a useful method 
for assessing bacterial attachment by measuring the staining of the adherent biomass. 
Because it utilizes a 96-well plate format, it is suitable as a tool for screening large numbers 
of bacterial strains or species. The air-liquid interface (ALI) assay (see Basic Protocol 2) is 
complementary to the microtiter plate biofilm assay in that it provides a mechanism for 
direct microscopic viewing of the live attached microbes. A colony-based biofilm system is 
also described (see Basic Protocol 3), with this system being especially useful for 
monitoring cell death in biofilms treated with antimicrobial agents. Finally, the Kadouri 
system (see Basic Protocol 4) is a “low-flow” system that can serve as a bridge between the 
static assays discussed in this unit and continuous-flow systems.

CAUTION: Follow all appropriate biosafety requirements relevant to the microorganism 
under investigation. Refer to UNIT 1A.1 and other pertinent resources (see APPENDIX 1B) 
for instructions on safe handling of microorganisms.

BASIC PROTOCOL 1: MICROTITER PLATE BIOFILM ASSAY

This experimental system, whose most common format is often referred to as the 96-well 
plate assay, is a simple high-throughput method used to monitor microbial attachment to an 
abiotic surface. While popularized in the mid-to-late 1990s (Mack et al., 1994; O’Toole et 
al., 1999), the assay in its typically used form is derived from a protocol published by 
Christensen et al. (1985). Examples of bacteria studied in this manner are listed in Table 1B.
1.1, although in theory, the protocol could be applied to any bacterial and fungal species 
amenable to growth in the prescribed format. In brief, cells are grown in microtiter dishes 
for a desired period of time, and then the wells are washed to remove planktonic bacteria. 
Cells remaining adhered to the wells are subsequently stained with a dye that allows 
visualization of the attachment pattern. This surface-associated dye can also be solubilized 
for semiquantitative assessment of the biofilm formed.

desired amount of time.

Lids for the microtiter dishes may be reused. Clean lids with 70% (v/v) 
ethanol and air-dry prior to each experiment.

first water tray and then vigorously shake out the liquid over the waste tray. 
Replace water when it becomes cloudy.

Add 125 μl of 0.1% crystal violet solution to each well. Stain 10 min at room 
temperature.

Shake each microtiter dish out over the waste tray to remove the crystal violet 
solution. Wash dishes successively in each of the next two water trays (i.e., the 
two not used in step 4), and shake out as much liquid as possible after each 
wash.

This step will remove any crystal violet that is not specifically staining the 
adherent bacteria. The wash trays can be reused for a number of plates, but the 
water should be replaced when its color becomes dark or when the efficiency 
of the washes is observed to decrease.

Invert each microtiter dish and vigorously tap on paper towels to remove any 
excess liquid. Allow plates to air-dry.

At this stage, the staining is stable and the dried plates may be stored at room 
temperature for at least several weeks.

Add 200 μl of 30% acetic acid (or another appropriate solvent) to each stained 
well. Allow dye to solubilize by covering plates and incubating 10 to 15 min at 
room temperature.

30% acetic acid appears to more efficiently solubilize the CV stain than the 
previously recommended 95% ethanol, and does so from a wider range of 
microbes.

A number of reagents may be used to solubilize biofilms. Some suggestions 
are listed in Table 1B.1.1, but solvents should be tested empirically for each 
organism.

Briefly mix the contents of each well by pipetting, and then transfer 125 μl of 
the crystal violet/acetic acid solution from each well to a separate well in an 
optically clear flat-bottom 96-well plate. Measure the optical density (OD) of 
each of these 125-μl samples at a wavelength of 500 to 600 nm.

The authors suggest four replicate wells for each strain or species used in step 
2. The absorbance values from these replicates are sufficient to determine an 
average and standard deviation for each strain or species and thus provide a 
measure of the extent of biofilm formation. The number of replicates can be 
increased as desired.

The OD wavelengths are presented as a range to allow for variations in the 
capabilities of plate readers.

ALTERNATE PROTOCOL 1: DIRECT ENUMERATION OF BACTERIA IN 

BIOFILMS

The biofilm formed in the microtiter dish can also be quantitated by directly enumerating the 
bacteria adhering to the surface. This method, while more time consuming, avoids one 
drawback of the crystal violet assay—crystal violet stains not only cells, but essentially any 
material adhering to the surface of the plate (for example, matrix components), and 
therefore, crystal violet staining may overestimate the number of adherent bacteria.

Additional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1)

PBS (APPENDIX 2A), sterile

Agar plates of appropriate medium

Multichannel pipettor

8-ml plastic tubes with caps

Sonicator (e.g., Sonics and Materials VC-505)

Additional reagents and equipment for counting viable cells (Phelan, 1996)

1.

Inoculate biofilm assay plates as described in Basic Protocol 1, steps 1a and 2a or 
steps 1b and 2b.

2. Wash wells six times, each time using a multichannel pipettor to add 100 μl sterile 
PBS per well and then vigorously shaking out the liquid over a waste container to 
remove planktonic cells.

3. Use scissors to cut each individual well from the microtiter plate. Add 100 μl PBS 

to each well.

4. Add each well (i.e., the actual plastic well plus its contents) to a separate 8-ml tube 
containing 1.9 ml PBS (for a final liquid volume of 2 ml). Cap before and after 
addition.

This step is performed so that each sample can be sonicated (step 5) in an 8-ml 
tube. Microtiter wells are not suitable for use as sonication vessels, as they are 
too small.

5.

Insert sonicator microtip and sonicate the contents of each tube for 8 sec at 40% 
power. Perform viable counts (Phelan, 1996) on the resulting suspensions by 
plating on agar medium to enumerate bacteria that were attached to the microtiter 
well surface.

To verify that the sonication procedure does not reduce cell viability, perform 
viable counts on a separate culture of planktonic cells before and after sonication. 
If reduced cell viability is seen, adjust the sonication regimen accordingly.

If desired, use crystal violet staining followed by microscopy to determine the 
efficacy of sonication in dislodging attached cells from microtiter well walls.

Perform crystal violet assay as in Basic Protocol 1. Lack of a crystal violet ring 
indicates that the bacterial cells have been removed from the wall of the well.

BASIC PROTOCOL 2: AIR-LIQUID INTERFACE ASSAY

Often, a great deal can be learned about the biofilm formation behavior of a particular 
bacterium simply by observing the early stages of this process, including attachment and 
early microcolony formation. This point may be particularly relevant for mutants identified 
in the 96-well plate assay described above.

The air-liquid interface (ALI) assay provides a simple system for microscopic analysis of 
biofilm formation over a time range of ~4 to 48 hr (Caiazza and O’Toole, 2004). A 24-well 
plate is placed at an angle of 30° to 50° relative to horizontal, and stationary-phase cultures 
are diluted and slowly applied to these wells such that the upper edge of each culture aliquot 
is positioned at the center of a well’s bottom. The bacteria of interest are allowed to grow in 
this manner for an appropriate length of time, and then the wells are rinsed gently and 
viewed by phase-contrast microscopy. See Background Information for a more thorough 
discussion of this assay.

Materials

Bacterial strains of interest

Appropriate media for bacteria under study (APPENDIX 2C)

Flat-bottom 24-well plate, sterile, with lid

Large paper clips or microcentrifuge tube rack and lab tape

Inverted microscope

1. Adjust a sterile, flat-bottom, 24-well plate so that it sits at a 30° to 50° angle from 

horizontal.

The method used will depend on the brand of plate and the available materials. 
One approach is to affix four large paperclips to one end of the plate. The 
paperclips stably elevate the end of the plate to which they are attached, while the 
opposite end remains low (see Fig. 1B.1.1). Alternatively, one end of the plate 
may be rested on a microcentrifuge tube rack (or anything of the desired height) 
and stabilized with tape to prevent slipping.

If possible, set up the angled plate in the warm room or incubator to be used for 
sample culturing, and load the wells there (step 4) to avoid potential disruption of 
the sample meniscuses upon transport.

2.

Inoculate each bacterium of interest in a 3- to 5-ml culture and grow to stationary 
phase (or to some other appropriate stage of growth).

3. Dilute the stationary-phase (or other appropriate) cultures 1:100 in appropriate 

media.

Approximately 300 μl diluted culture will be needed for each well that is to be 
inoculated in the angled 24-well dish.

4. Carefully pipet an aliquot (~300 μl) of each diluted culture into a separate well in 
the angled 24-well plate such that the upper edge of the aliquot just reaches the 
center of the bottom of the well. Cover plate with lid and incubate at appropriate 
temperature for desired period of time.

When inoculating each well, it is important to slowly add the culture down the 
lower wall to avoid wetting the entire bottom of the well. The meniscus of the 
liquid should pass through the center of the well, which is often the most 
optically clear part. This will ensure that the air-liquid interface is appropriately 
positioned for viewing.

5. Aspirate culture from the wells and gently wash twice, each time by adding 400 μl 
sterile medium and then aspirating. After completing these two washes, add ~200 
μl medium (i.e., enough to cover the bottom of the well) to each well.

Washing should remove most of the unattached bacteria from the wells. This is 
important, as planktonic cells can make viewing more difficult and can continue 
to colonize surfaces, potentially obscuring the air-liquid interface.

6. Lay the plate flat on the stage of an inverted microscope and visualize by phase-

contrast or epifluorescent microscopy. Focus just above the center of the bottom of 
the well to observe bacteria at the air-liquid interface.

Depending on the bacterial species and conditions, the bacteria may form a well-
defined aggregations at the ALI. The ALI will occur wherever the meniscus of 
the culture was in contact with the plastic, but it will be most visible in the center 
of the well, where the well tends to be the most optically clear. If desired, the 
ALI may be circled on the bottom of the plate with a wax pencil prior to 
microscopic analysis to aid in its identification. Some sample results obtained 
with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are shown in Figure 1B.1.2.

ALTERNATE PROTOCOL 2: AIR-LIQUID INTERFACE COVERSLIP ASSAY

If an inverted microscope is not available, a plastic or glass coverslip can be placed in a well 
of a in a 24-well plate such that the air-liquid interface of the culture is in the approximate 
center of the coverslip. After an appropriate incubation, the coverslip is rinsed, stained with 
crystal violet, and visualized by conventional microscopy using an upright microscope.

Additional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2)

0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in water

Flat-bottom multiwell (e.g., 12-well) plates, sterile, with lids

Glass or plastic coverslips (e.g., Fisherbrand unbreakable 22-mm2 coverslips; Fisher 
Scientific catalog no. 12-547)

Conventional, upright microscope

1.

Inoculate each bacterium of interest in a 3- to 5-ml culture and grow to stationary 
phase (or to some other appropriate stage of growth).

2. Dilute the stationary-phase (or other appropriate) cultures 1:100 in appropriate 

media.

3. Use each diluted culture to fill a well in a flat-bottom multiwell plate to 

approximately half of its capacity.

Almost any size multiwell dish is acceptable for use in this assay, as coverslips 
are available in a variety of sizes. Plastic coverslips, such as those listed above, 
can easily be cut to the appropriate size with a pair of scissors.

4.

Insert a coverslip into each well so that it is held at a 90° angle relative to the 
bottom of the well (i.e., perpendicular to the bottom of the well) so that the 
meniscus of the medium is at the center of the coverslip. Cover plate and incubate 
at appropriate temperature for desired period of time.

5. Remove each coverslip from its well and rinse off nonadherent cells by dipping in 

sterile medium.

6. Stain bacteria by submerging coverslips in 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min.

7. Rinse off excess dye by dipping each coverslip in two successive water baths, and 

then allow coverslips to air-dry.

8. Visualize the bacteria at the air-liquid interface on each coverslip by microscopy.

BASIC PROTOCOL 3: COLONY BIOFILM ASSAY

A colony biofilm is grown on a semipermeable membrane that sits on an agar plate (Fig. 1B.
1.3). The bacteria in this type of biofilm can be given a new supply of nutrients simply by 
relocating the membrane-grown cells to a fresh agar plate. One therefore can easily change 
the carbon source or type of drug treatment while avoiding the need to wash the cells. The 
colony biofilm has been especially useful in the study of the antibiotic-resistant properties of 
cells. The method provided below is an example of the use of a colony biofilm to study the 
effects of antibiotic treatment.

The other biofilm systems presented in this unit involve attachment of bacteria to a surface 
while bathed in liquid medium. This is the only protocol where the substratum to which the 
bacteria attach themselves is also the avenue for meeting nutritional needs and removing 
waste. For that reason, this assay is more analogous to growing bacteria on plates rather than 
in broth. In this protocol, however, the colonies can grow much larger, because they are 
periodically relocated to fresh plates and thus have a fresh supply of nutrients. An advantage 
of this system is that the biofilms formed are derived from clonal growth of the original 
population of bacteria deposited on the filter, whereas in liquid media, motile bacteria may 
be able to “invade” an aggregation of cells. Likewise, in the system described below, 
bacteria have limited ability to detach and migrate or drift away from the biofilm formed. 
The stable and spatially restricted nature of this system makes the colony biofilm especially 
useful for observing the effects of antimicrobial agents, as changes in cell number can be 
more easily attributed to cell death rather than detachment.

Bacterial strain of interest

Appropriate liquid medium for bacterial strain under study (APPENDIX 2C)

Appropriate agar medium with and without antibiotic (or other) supplementation

PBS (APPENDIX 2A), sterile

Forceps, sterilized (e.g., autoclaved or flame-sterilized in 70% v/v ethanol)

Poretics 25-mm-diameter black polycarbonate membranes with pore size of 0.22 μm 
(GE Osmonics catalog no. K02BP02500)

100-mm-diameter Petri dishes, sterile

UV light source (e.g., UVP 8-W multiple-ray laboratory lamp)

15-ml tubes, sterile, with tightly fitting lids

Vortex mixer

1. On the night before the colony biofilm assay is to be started, inoculate the 

bacterium of interest in 3- to 5-ml cultures and grow overnight (i.e., to stationary 
phase).

2. Using sterilized forceps, place 25-mm black polycarbonate membranes with a pore 

size of 0.22 μm in a sterile Petri plate. Position plate ~30 cm from a UV light 
source and treat with UV light in a sterile environment (e.g., a biological control 
hood) for 10 min per side, using the sterilized forceps to flip the plate.

Here and in all subsequent steps, the Petri plate should be kept covered whenever 
possible to maintain the sterility of the membranes.

The number of membranes needed depends on the desired length of the 
experiment. Two membranes are required for the initial baseline count of cells 
(in duplicate), and four more are needed for each time point (for duplicate 
sampling of treated and untreated cells). Additionally, a few extra membranes 
may be desirable as backups. For example, starting with sixteen membranes per 
strain for an experiment with a 72-hr antibiotic treatment period will allow 
duplicate sampling of treated and untreated cells every 24 hr, leaving two extra 
backup membranes per strain.

3. Dilute stationary-phase cultures (step 1) in the appropriate medium to an OD600 of 

0.05 (~1.64 × 108 cfu/ml).

4. Place a membrane (step 2) with its shiny side up on an agar medium plate not 

containing antibiotic, and inoculate with 5 μl diluted culture. Repeat this procedure 
for all remaining membranes from step 2, inoculating up to six membranes on the 
same agar plate. When the liquid on the membranes has dried, incubate plates 
upright at appropriate temperature for 24 hr.

5. Using sterile forceps, gently lift each membrane off of its agar plate and transfer to 

a fresh agar plate at up to six membranes per plate. Incubate plates 24 hr at 
appropriate temperature.

Flame-sterilized forceps must be cooled before touching the membranes.

The entire surface of the membrane should be in direct contact with the agar in 
the fresh plate. Air bubbles may be removed simply by gently lifting the 
membrane and repositioning it on the plate.

Following this step, the colony biofilms will have been grown for a total of 48 hr. 
Membranes are transferred to new plates every 24 hr hereafter to provide a fresh 
nutrient supply or to expose the colony biofilms to fresh antimicrobial agents.

6. After the incubation in step 5 is complete, sample biofilm growth in the following 

way.

a. Aseptically transfer a membrane to each of two separate 15-ml tubes 
containing 10 ml sterile PBS, such that each tube contains a single 
membrane.

The membrane can be gently folded over onto itself before it is lifted off 
the plate. Doing so will allow the membrane to fit easily into a 15-ml tube.

b. Cap tubes and vortex samples for two pulses of 60 sec each (or as necessary) 

to detach all bacteria.

c. Prepare dilution series of the vortexed samples, and plate each dilution on a 
separate agar plate. Incubate plates overnight at the appropriate temperature 
and determine the average number of colony-forming units (cfu) per 
membrane.

The counts obtained here will serve as the baseline for future 
experimentation; this sampling time point is designated T = 0 with respect 
to the start of experimental treatments.

7. Transfer half of the remaining membranes (step 5) to fresh agar plates not 

containing antibiotic, and transfer the other half to agar plates supplemented with 
antibiotic at the appropriate concentration. Incubate all plates at appropriate 
temperature for 24 hr.

8. When incubation is complete, sample biofilm growth (as in step 6) in two untreated 

membranes and two treated membranes. Transfer the remaining untreated 
membranes to fresh agar plates not containing antibiotic, and transfer the remaining 
treated membranes to fresh agar plates supplemented with antibiotic at the 
appropriate concentration. Incubate plates at appropriate temperature for another 24 
hr.

9. Repeat step 8 until all colony biofilms have been sampled.

BASIC PROTOCOL 4: KADOURI DRIP-FED BIOFILM ASSAY

This system overcomes one limitation of the other static systems presented in this unit by 
constantly refreshing the bacterial growth medium. Bacterial growth can therefore be 
maintained for a much longer period, allowing formation of mature biofilms. A 6-well plate 
is inoculated with culture, and growth medium is pumped into each well through a needle 
that has been inserted through the plate lid; waste and planktonic cells exit through a second 
needle and are pumped away from the well. Biofilm formation can be monitored as desired 
by visualizing the bottom of each well using an inverted microscope. See Background 
Information for a more thorough discussion of this assay.

Flat-bottom 6-well plates, sterile, with lids

1/16 × 1/16–in. (~0.16 × 0.16–cm) straight and 90°-elbow, barbed, polypropylene 
fittings (such as those included in Cole-Parmer catalog no. 6365-90)

0.8- to 1.6-mm-i.d. silicone tubing (e.g., Watson-Marlow catalog no. 913.A008.016 or 
913.A016.016)

almost to the bottom of a 2-liter flask) and a short glass tube (for gas exchange)

Peristaltic pump (e.g., Watson-Marlow PumpPro) equipped with Marprene manifold 
tubing (inner diameter, 0.8 mm; e.g., Watson-Marlowe catalog no. 978.0165.000)

Inverted microscope (UNIT 2A.1)

Modify 6-well plate lid

1. Heat a 20-G needle in the flame of a Bunsen burner. Push the heated needle 

through the lid of a 6-well plate such that it enters directly above one side of a well. 
Remove the needle and repeat this process to make a hole in the lid directly above 
the opposite side of the same well.

The holes should be large enough for the needle to pass through freely.

These holes will serve as ports for connecting a peristaltic pump that will supply 
growth medium to and carry waste away from the well. If desired, multiple wells 
may be prepared on the same plate and/or multiple plates may be run from the

same pump simultaneously, depending on the number of channels the pump has 
for tubing.

2. Obtain two straight 1/16 × 1/16–in. (~0.16 × 0.16–cm) barbed polypropylene 

fittings (i.e., the type used to connect two pieces of tubing). Using a sharp razor 
blade, carefully cut off one of the two male ends on each fitting to give a modified 
fitting with one male end and a flat base (see Fig. 1B.1.4).

3. Set the flat base of each modified fitting on top of the 6-well plate lid (step 1) such 

that the hole in the fitting lines up with one of the holes in the lid, and then pass a 
20-G needle through both the fitting and the hole in the lid to maintain the 
alignment. Secure each fitting to the lid of the plate using a silicone sealant, and let 
the sealant dry completely (see Fig. 1B.1.4).

Once constructed, this modified lid can be sterilized with ethanol or UV 
irradiation and reused multiple times with fresh plates in subsequent experiments.

Set up pump apparatus

1. Taking into account the Marprene manifold tubing already installed at the various 
ports on the peristaltic pump, cut lengths of silicone tubing to sizes appropriate for 
the following connections (Fig. 1B.1.5): (1) medium reservoir to pump; (2) pump 
to 6-well plate; (3) 6-well plate back to pump; and (4) pump to waste receptacle. 
Attach 90°-elbow fittings to the tube ends that are to be connected to the modified 
plate lid.

Prepare to run the system

Fill a 2-liter flask with 500 ml water and fit with a no. 8, two-hole, rubber 
stopper equipped with one long and one short glass tube. Cover the tube ends 
with foil. Fill separate 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks with 1.5 liters water, 500 ml 
water, and 1.5 liters of medium appropriate for growing the biofilm of interest.

The 500-ml portion of autoclaved water in the stoppered flask will be used to 
adjust the liquid flow rate in step 8. The other 500-ml portion of autoclaved 
water will serve as the solvent for the hypochlorite solution used to sterilize 
the pumping system in step 10, and the 1.5-liter portion of autoclaved water 
will be used to rinse the hypochlorite solution out of the system in step 11.

Submerge the silicone tubing from step 4, not including the Marprene manifold 
tubing already installed on the pump, in a beaker containing distilled water and 
cover with foil. Autoclave along with the flasks prepared in step 5.

Connect the plate lid to the medium reservoir line and the waste line as follows 
(also see Fig. 1B.1.5).

a. Using polypropylene fittings, connect one of the intake lines on the pump 
to the silicone tubing that will eventually lead to the medium reservoir. 
Connect the corresponding outflow line to the end opposite the 90° elbow 
on one of the silicone tubes that will eventually connect to the modified 
plate lid.

b. Connect another outflow line on the pump to the silicone tubing that will 
eventually lead to the waste receptacle. Connect the corresponding intake 
line to the end opposite the 90° elbow on the other silicone tube that will 
eventually connect to the modified plate lid (Fig. 1B.1.5).

c. Attach a sterile 20-G needle to the elbow fitting on each of the two 
silicone tubes that are to be connected to the modified plate lid.

8

Adjust the growth medium influx and efflux rates in the following way.

a. Place a sterile, capped microcentrifuge tube in a rack and make two 

small, diametrically opposed holes in the lid using a 20-G needle heated 
over a flame.

b. Pipet ~1 ml of flow-adjustment water (step 5) into the open tube, close 

the lid, and then insert the 20-G needles from step 7 through the holes in 
the lid.

c. Return the two-hole rubber stopper to the flask containing the flow-

adjustment water. Connect the silicone tubing that will eventually serve 
as the growth medium intake line to the long glass tube on the stopper, 
and place the open end of the appropriate silicone tube in the waste 
receptacle.

d. Start the peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 12 ml/hr (2.0 rpm on a Watson-
Marlow PumpPro). Adjust the tension on the manifold tubing such that 
the water level in the microcentrifuge tube is steady or slightly 
decreasing.

The purpose of this step is to adjust the liquid flow such that the well 
will neither dry out nor overflow during the actual experiment. 
Increasing the flow rate and observing for a period of time will make 
subsequent recognition of steady or slightly decreasing water levels 
easier.

10

Stop the pump, remove the 20-G needles from the microcentrifuge tube, and 
insert them into the modified fittings on the 6-well plate lid.

To 500 ml sterile H2O (step 5), add sodium hypochlorite to a final concentration 
of 0.05% (v/v). Remove the two-hole rubber stopper (still connected to the 
eventual growth medium intake line) from the flask containing the flow-
adjustment water, squirt 70% ethanol around its sides, and transfer it to the flask 
containing the sodium hypochlorite solution. Restart the pump and run the 
sodium hypochlorite solution through the system for at least 3 hr at a flow rate 
of 12 ml/hr.

Rinsing with 70% ethanol solution will help ensure sterility each time the 
rubber stopper is transferred to a new flask. In addition, flushing with sodium 
hypochlorite sterilizes the pump’s Marprene tubing, which cannot be 
autoclaved.

Turn off the pump and aseptically transfer the two-hole rubber stopper (still 
connected to the eventual growth medium intake line) to the flask containing 1.5 
liters of sterile water for rinsing. Restart the pump and flush the system with this 
water for 3 hr or overnight, adjusting the flow rate as necessary to equalize the 
inflow and ouflow of liquid.

This rinsing step removes the sodium hypochlorite from the system and helps 
ensure that the input and output flow are balanced.

Inoculate the bacterium of interest in a 3- to 5-ml culture and incubate overnight 
at appropriate temperature.

Dilute the stationary-phase culture 1:100 in appropriate medium, and inoculate 
~3 ml of this diluted culture into the appropriate well of a new 6-well plate (i.e., 
a well whose position on the plate will allow the bacteria to receive growth 
medium through the modified plate lid). Allow bacteria to adhere to the well for 
3 hr or as appropriate for the organism of interest.

At the end of the adhering period, pipet excess medium from the well and 
replace with ~3 ml fresh medium.

Turn off the pump and transfer the two-hole rubber stopper (still connected to 
the growth medium intake line) to the flask containing 1.5 liters sterilized 
medium.

Transfer the modified plate lid (still connected to the peristaltic pump through 
two 20-G needles) to the 6-well plate from step 14. Pass medium into the well of 
interest by restarting the pump at a rate of 10 ml/hr, and maintain this flow 
throughout biofilm growth.

Establish biofilm by incubating the system at appropriate temperature and 
replenishing the growth medium reservoir flask as necessary.

Monitor biofilm growth at desired intervals in the following way.

a. Pause the pump, transfer the modified lid to another sterile 6-well plate, 
and place a new sterile lid over the biofilm-containing plate for transport.

b. Gently remove planktonic cells from the biofilm-containing well by 

pipetting off the liquid medium, and then wash the well twice, each time 
by adding 1.0 ml sterile medium and aspirating.

c. Cover the bottom of the well with a small amount of fresh medium to 

keep the biomass hydrated, and then view through an inverted 
microscope.

d. When viewing is complete, reconnect the plate to the pump system 

(through the modified plate lid) and resume the flow of growth medium.

Upon completion of experiment, detach the modified 6-well plate lid and 20-G 
needles from the elbow fittings on the silicone tubing, and then use a small (~15-
cm) piece of silicone tubing to bridge the two elbow fittings.

Sterilize the system by flushing with 0.05% sodium hypochlorite as in step 10, 
and then rinse by flushing with sterile water as in step 11.

Dismantle all tubing and coil it gently into the bottom of a 1-liter beaker. Cover 
with distilled water, cover beaker with foil, and autoclave to sterilize.

After autoclaving, the tubing may be reused for future experiments; however, 
before setting up a new system, be sure to examine the entire length of each 
piece of tubing for clogs or holes that could cause pressure build-ups or leaks.

COMMENTARY

Background Information

Microtiter Plate Assay—Permutations of the microtiter dish biofilm assay (see Basic 
Protocol 1) have been in use for a number of years, due to their ease of use and the 
adaptability of the general protocol to a variety of applications. This assay is equally well 
suited to the analysis of tens or hundreds of strains or species and is particularly useful as the 
basis of a genetic screen for mutants defective in surface attachment capabilities. Once 
conditions have been determined in which the wild-type strain forms a biofilm, a library of 
mutants can be screened to identify those that differ in terms of the extent or kinetics of 
attachment. Additionally, slight modifications to this system would allow one to look at the 
influence of other variables that may affect biofilm formation, such as nutritional provision 
(e.g., the carbon or nitrogen source used or the availability of phosphate or iron) or the 
presence of antibiotics or detergents. It is important to keep in mind that due to the indirect 
nature of biofilm assessment in this system, it is desirable to pair this assay with another 
method to further examine biofilm formation. For example, using direct microscopic 
observation of the biofilm to confirm the crystal violet staining pattern is suggested.

Air-Liquid Interface Assay—This technique (see Basic Protocol 2) emerged from a 
simple adjustment to the typical practice of growing biofilms in multiwell plates. Many 
bacteria are limited to or prefer aerobic growth and therefore are most prone to forming 
biofilms at the interface between the medium and air. By tilting the 24-well plate such that 
the air-liquid interface (ALI) falls on an optically clear portion of the plate, the potential for 
microscopic analysis is improved. This system makes an excellent companion to the 
microtiter dish assay (see Basic Protocol 1), as both are useful at many of the same time 
points and stages of biofilm formation. This assay also allows the visualization of live 
bacteria without the need for crystal violet staining; therefore, real-time interactions of the 
bacteria with the surface can be monitored (Caiazza and O’Toole, 2004). The ALI assay can 
be extended to later time points by replacing the growth medium periodically, but for an 
accurate study of a mature biofilm, a system in which the medium is continually replaced, 
such as the Kadouri system (see Basic Protocol 4) or a flow cell–based system (UNIT 1B.2), 
is recommended.

Colony Biofilms—Colony biofilms (see Basic Protocol 3) have typically been used for the 
purpose of determining antibiotic resistance (Anderl et al., 2000; Walters et al., 2003). Such 
systems are well suited to studies of the viability of cells within a biofilm in response to 
various assaults, such as exposure to antimicrobial agents or UV light.

Kadouri System—The Kadouri drip-fed biofilm system (named for the postdoctoral 
researcher who developed it) is a close relative of the continuous-flow biofilm systems 
presented in other units in this chapter. Although the medium is constantly being exchanged 
in this system (see Basic Protocol 4), the shear forces on the bacteria are minimal; therefore, 
this system may apply less mechanical stress to the biofilms. Planktonic cells in this system 
are not swiftly swept away but may linger in the well for longer periods. Hence, the system 
may be more closely representative of an equilibrium state between the attached and 
planktonic lifestyles. This system is typically considered a “low-flow” scheme and serves as 
an intermediate regimen between static assays and standard flow cell systems; however, 
because the system involves continuous feeding with growth medium, it allows observation 
of the entire process of biofilm formation, from reversible to irreversible attachment and on 
to microcolony formation, macrocolony formation, and detachment. One advantage this 
system provides is the potential to generate and easily access a relatively large amount of 
biomass that can be scraped from the bottom of the well and used for applications such as 
DNA microarrays and proteomics. This system is also useful for many of the microscopy 
assays typically done by flow cell–based methods. The 6-well plate format also has the 
advantage of being easily adaptable to the testing of multiple growth conditions or bacterial 
species.

Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting

Microtiter Plate Assay—When using the microtiter plate assay, it is important to have a 
strong positive control (i.e., a wild-type strain) and, if possible, a negative control (e.g., 
uninoculated medium) on each test plate. Enough variability can emerge in terms of 
incubation conditions or washing so that intraplate comparisons are preferable, especially 
when one strives to observe a subtle difference between bacterial species or strains. 
Additionally, it is important to note that there are factors that can affect the results of this 
assay other than an organism’s ability to adhere to the surface. For example, a growth defect 
could easily be mistaken for a lack of attachment capability.

The microtiter plate suggested for the studies described in this protocol is U-shaped, 
nonsterile, and relatively inexpensive. Nonsterile plates work well with fast-growing 
organisms such as E. coli or pseudomonads, which easily outcompete contaminants in the 8 
to 10 hr it takes to complete the biofilm assay. For slow-growing or fastidious organisms, 
however, it is recommended that sterile plates be used. For nonmotile organisms, such as 
staphylococci, sterile, flat-bottom plates are recommended.

ALI Assay

Although the ALI assay involves a relatively simple system, there are a few important points 
necessary for successful execution. The ALI should be a well-defined boundary, so care 
must be taken to avoid wetting the entire bottom of the well during inoculation. Setting up

the angled plate in an incubator or warm room and inoculating it in place is a simple way to 
prevent disturbances to the system. Placement of the air-liquid interface at the center of the 
bottom of the well will provide the best opportunity for obtaining sharp images by phase-
contrast microscopy. In addition, the wells should never be allowed to dry out. If this is a 
problem, consider adding more medium in the initial setup, decreasing the incubation time, 
or placing the entire system inside a humidified chamber, which can be improvised by 
placing some dampened paper towels in the bottom of a plastic container with a lid.

Occasionally, there may be difficulty in locating the air-liquid interface for microscopic 
examination. There are a number of situations that could lead to this problem. If the initial 
inoculum has a low cell count and the incubation time is short, there may be an insufficient 
number of bacteria adhered to the surface at the time of viewing, and this may make 
identification of the ALI more difficult. If this is the case, consider starting with a less dilute 
inoculum or increasing the incubation time. Alternatively, circling the ALI with a wax 
pencil may make it easier to locate under the microscope. Stringent washing of the wells is 
useful for removing any unattached bacteria; this wash step will help prevent colonization of 
the formerly dry portion of the well after the whole well has been bathed in medium. Even 
under the best washing conditions, bacteria can detach from surfaces and colonize other 
portions of the well. For this reason, it is important to work quickly and analyze plates on a 
microscope immediately after they have been prepared for observation. If there are many 
strains or species to analyze, it may be advisable to distribute them over a number of plates 
so that only a few need be prepared for viewing at one time.

Colony Biofilms—One important aspect of this assay is the predetermination of 
appropriate experimental conditions (e.g., antibiotic concentration). The resistance of a 
bacterium to antimicrobial agents in a colony biofilm may differ significantly from the 
resistance of the same bacterium in a different biofilm system, such as the microtiter plate 
biofilm assay system described earlier in this unit (see Basic Protocol 1). It is recommended 
that the organism be tested on various concentrations of antibiotic to find appropriate 
experimental conditions.

The initial inoculation of the colony biofilm is an important step that can affect the success 
of the experiment. It is important to ensure that each membrane receives an equal amount of 
cells and that there is only a single point of inoculation in the center of the membrane. To 
prevent any of the culture from spraying elsewhere on the membrane, touch the drop of 
liquid at the end of the pipet tip gently to the membrane before depressing the pipet plunger 
to its final stop. A single, carefully centered spot will ensure the greatest experimental 
reproducibility, as the counting is no longer accurate if the bacteria have grown off the edges 
of the membrane. In addition, complete and uniform removal of the bacteria from the 
membrane is important for accuracy. Empirically testing different conditions to maximize 
removal of bacteria from the membrane during the vortexing step while preserving viability 
is recommended.

Kadouri System—Two common problems that are experienced in this system are 
overflow and drying out of the wells. Both can be addressed by very carefully calibrating the 
influx and efflux rates (see Basic Protocol 4, step 8). If the medium is evaporating too

quickly from the system, consider increasing the influx rate to compensate. Likewise, 
ensuring that there is sufficient medium in the reservoir is especially crucial when the 
system will be left unattended for long periods. Due to the nature of biofilm-forming 
bacteria, it is also important to carefully monitor the tubing prior to each experiment. The 
waste tubes are especially prone to being colonized, and the colonizing bacteria can 
completely block the flow, causing pressure to build up and rupture the junctions between 
pieces of tubing. If blockage is found, the piece of tubing must be trimmed to remove the 
clogged portion, or else the entire section must be replaced.

This system is designed for observation of biofilms forming on the bottoms of the wells, but 
depending on the conditions and the strain or species used, the cells may in addition (or 
instead) form a biofilm, known as a pellicle, at the air-liquid interface. To prevent this, the 
environment at the bottom of the plate should be made as hospitable as possible for the 
bacteria. A common problem is the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the well. This may be 
overcome by increasing the flow rate in the system to deliver more oxygenated medium to 
the cells while more rapidly removing unattached bacteria. In some cases, adjusting the 
composition of the medium (e.g., by providing an alternative electron acceptor) will 
decrease the requirement for oxygen. As with all of the systems presented in this unit, 
optimal conditions must be determined empirically for each organism.

After the setup is complete, this system requires little daily attention as the cells grow. It 
should be monitored periodically (twice a day) for overflow or evaporation of the media in 
the wells and for potential rupture of tubing, and also to ensure that there is an ample supply 
of medium in the reservoir. However, biofilms may take over a week to develop to the 
desired stage (as determined by microscopic observation), and this should be taken into 
consideration when planning experiments.

Anticipated Results

Microtiter Plate Assay—Using the microtiter plate assay is an effective way to monitor 
bacterial attachment to an abiotic surface over time. In general, if this assay were performed 
over several time points, one would expect to see a progressive increase, possibly followed 
by a decrease, in attached biomass. The eventual decrease in crystal violet staining is 
presumed to occur because the lack of nutrients may stimulate the bacteria to detach from 
the surface (Sawyer and Hermanowicz, 1998; Hunt et al., 2004). The time course of biofilm 
growth must be determined empirically for each organism and set of conditions used. The 
staining pattern also varies from one organism to another. For example, when P. aeruginosa 
is grown with only oxygen as an electron acceptor, a ring of staining forms at the air-
medium interface. In contrast, when this species is grown on arginine, a carbon source used 
aerobically and anaerobically by P. aeruginosa, the entire well shows positive crystal violet 
staining. Examples of typical results with this assay for P. aeruginosa are shown in Figure 
1B.1.6.

Direct Enumeration of Bacteria from Microtiter Plate Assay—When bacteria are 
grown in the microtiter plate assay, one generally expects to see increased adherent biomass 
over a period of time followed by a decrease as the bacteria detach or die. The number of cfu

eluted from each well is expected to correlate with the amount of crystal violet staining 
obtained at the corresponding time point.

ALI Assay—For bacterial species that form a ring around the well in the microtiter plate 
assay, the air-liquid interface should be heavily colonized with attached bacteria in this 
system. For nonmotile or facultative anaerobic bacteria, the boundary may not be as well 
defined. Some typical results obtained with the bacterium P. aeruginosa are displayed in 
Figure 1B.1.2.

ALI Coverslip Assay—The results for this variation of the ALI assay should be very 
similar to those noted above, with the exception that the crystal violet staining kills the 
bacteria. Because of this, the stained coverslips are relatively stable and may be stored 
upwards of a week prior to microscopy.

Colony Biofilms—The colony biofilm protocol allows assessment of the effects of 
antibiotics (or other experimental treatments) on a colony of bacteria grown on a solid 
substratum. Typically, it is expected that bacteria within a biofilm will display a greater 
resistance to bacteriocidal agents than will planktonic bacteria.

Kadouri System—Various stages of biofilm formation can be observed with this system. 
An example of the formation of a P. aeruginosa biofilm over 48 hr is shown in Figure 1B.
1.7.

Time Considerations

Microtiter Plate Assay—After the biofilm plates have been inoculated from stationary-
phase cultures, results may be obtained in 2 to 30 hr. This, of course, depends on the desired 
time course and the size of the experiment. Only a small percentage of this time involves 
hands-on work, however, including the initial inoculation, staining of plates, and dye 
solubilization. If only a few bacterial strains or species are being tested, these steps may take 
as little as an hour in total. Alternate Protocol 1, in which viable counts are performed to 
enumerate the attached bacteria, will take longer, as more handling is involved and the 
plated bacteria will need to be incubated for another 12 to 24 hr for the colonies to grow 
large enough to be counted.

ALI Assay—The ALI assay follows a time course similar to that of the microtiter plate 
assay. The length of the assay will again depend on the desired time frame to be studied. 
Washing of plates followed by microscopic analysis takes ~15 min per well. Alternate 
Protocol 2 is similar to the ALI assay in terms of its time requirements.

Colony Biofilms—During the growth of colony biofilms, the bacteria require little 
attention, except that the membranes must be transferred to fresh plates every 24 hr. Over 
the course of an experiment, the separation of bacteria from the membrane and subsequent 
enumeration are the most labor-intensive steps. An important consideration regarding the 
experimental timing in this protocol is the requirement for pregrowth of the colony biofilm

(i.e., growth prior to the experimental treatment). This requires membranes to be inoculated 
48 hr in advance of antibiotic testing.

Kadouri System—The amount of time required to grow a biofilm in this system depends 
on the desired maturity, the growth conditions (e.g., medium, temperature), and the 
organism used. In general, it can be expected that a biofilm will be able to reach maturity 
within a week of inoculation. Setup of the apparatus should be done 24 hr before inoculation 
to allow sufficient time for bleaching and rinsing of the system prior to use.
