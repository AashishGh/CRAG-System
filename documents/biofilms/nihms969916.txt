Introduction

We focus this chapter on turning a biofilm inside out. The “inside” of the biofilm comprises 
the individual biofilm-related phenotypes, their environmental drivers and genetic 
determinants, and the coordination of gene functions through transcriptional regulators. 
Investigators have viewed the inside of the biofilm through diverse approaches, and this 
chapter will attempt to capture the essence of many. The ultimate goal is to connect the 
inside to the “outside,” which we view as biofilm structure, development, pharmacological 
attributes, and medical impact.

Biofilms are surface-associated microbial communities, encased in self-produced 
extracellular material, that exhibit phenotypes distinct from those of planktonic (free-living) 
cells. Microbes are thought to grow predominantly as biofilms in nature. (13). The surfaces 
with which biofilm cells are associated may be diverse, and include solid abiotic materials, 
tissues and cells, and air-water interfaces. In fact, a colony growing on an agar plate is a 
biofilm!

Biofilm cells are quite different from the mid-logarithmic phase planktonic cells that modern 
microbiologists were trained to study (see (91)). Biofilm populations are invariably 
heterogeneous (Figure 1A). Cells at the periphery of the biofilm are bathed in the external 
medium; cells at the base of the biofilm may be limited for nutrients and oxygen, and 
surrounded by their neighbors’ waste products. Cells at the periphery may be exposed to a 
rapidly fluctuating environment; cells at the base are buffered from many abrupt changes. 
Thus a mature biofilm may include cells exposed to a range of different nutrients, and the 
biofilm cell population may be growing at a range of different rates.

Our focus on biofilms stems from their central role in infection biology (21). Biofilms are 
medically relevant in two major contexts: device-associated infection and in vivo growth. 
Device-associated infection is the phenomenon that presence of an implanted medical device 
is a significant risk factor for bloodstream or deep-tissue infection. The specific risk factor 
and the likely types of infecting organisms vary with the kind of device and its location. The 
connection to biofilm formation was first elucidated by Costerton and colleagues (21), who 
found biofilms of infecting organisms on the devices that were removed from infected 
patients. In the vast majority of cases, the devices are sterile when implanted, and later

become colonized by microbes that enter the bloodstream. The biofilm on a device serves as 
a reservoir that continually seeds the infection. Unfortunately, as detailed later in this 
chapter, biofilm cells are generally recalcitrant to antimicrobials; thus device removal may 
be the only therapeutic option. Because the usage of implanted devices continues to increase 
worldwide, the problem of device-associated infection will only grow in the future.

The second connection between biofilms and infection has to do with the nature of growth in 
vivo. Some infections are quite obviously surface-associated growth. Examples include 
mucosal infections such as thrush and vaginitis. Invasion of the surface may follow initial 
infection, and the surface itself may change over the course of infection due to inflammation 
and tissue damage. Other infections are not associated with host surfaces, but the infecting 
organisms grow as an aggregate encased in extracellular matrix material. The aggregates 
may be considered self-contained biofilms, analogous to the flocs that form at the end of 
industrial fermentations (107).

We now look inside fungal biofilms at the major biofilm-relevant phenotypes and, where 
known, the molecular mechanisms that govern those properties. We focus primarily on C. 
albicans, the biofilms of which have been studied extensively, as well as on A. fumigatus.

Adherence

A necessary step in biofilm formation is attachment to a biotic or abiotic surface. For C. 
albicans biofilms, the attachment step is achieved through adhesive proteins expressed on the 
cell surface that are usually in the category of Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol (GPI)-
anchored proteins. This kind of cell wall protein makes up a large portion of the total cell 
wall protein complement in C. albicans. Indeed, 115 putative GPI-anchored proteins have 
been identified, though more than half of these have no assigned function (86). The general 
structure of GPI-anchored proteins includes an N-terminal signal sequence, which traffics 
the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain site that 
allows the attachment of a pre-formed GPI anchor (103). A third structural part of GPI-
anchored proteins is the central region, which varies among proteins. Often, the central 
region contains repeats of conserved, functional units.

The Als (agglutinin-like sequence) family of adhesins is the most well known category of 
GPI-anchored proteins in C. albicans. We use Als proteins to illustrate many general 
principles of fungal adhesins. Mutants defective in expression of ALS1 and ALS3 have 
decreased adherence to host and abiotic substrates (68, 93, 111). Due to their cell surface 
expression and role in virulence, recombinant Als1 and Als3 have been investigated for use 
as vaccines with considerable success in mice (98). Als proteins contain the canonical GPI-
anchor components along with an immunoglobulin-like region near the N-terminal domain, 
a conserved threonine-rich region, tandem repeats of a threonine-rich sequence, and a serine- 
and threonine-rich stalk that is often highly glycosylated near the C-terminus (Figure 2). 
Each of these domains has been studied in detail and has been shown to be functionally 
important (16).

The Als immunoglobulin-like region has two immunoglobulin-like domains and a peptide-
binding cavity. This domain is responsible for binding to a broad range of host substrates 
such as E-cadherins, extracellular matrix proteins, or fucose containing-glycans (16, 79, 84). 
Although ligand binding by Als proteins in solution is relatively weak, the loss of a highly 
expressed Als protein has a very dramatic effect on adherence. This conundrum spurred 
further structural and biochemical analysis of the N-terminal regions of several Als proteins. 
Three Als regions are critical for substrate binding – the peptide-binding cavity, the 
threonine-rich region, and the tandem repeat region (Figure 2). The peptide-binding cavity 
interacts directly with ligands (47, 89), and the other regions mediate Als protein 
aggregation, as discussed below.

Following the N-terminus, there is a threonine-rich region (T). One function of this region is 
to promote secretion, though the mechanistic basis for this role is not understood (84). The 
second function is related to a highly conserved amyloid-forming domain within this region 
that mediates Als protein association, yielding polyvalent Als protein aggregates. This 
domain has been explored in detail by the Lipke group (77). Using atomic force microscopy 
and amyloid binding dyes such as thioflavin T, amyloid formation was observed with 
surface-expressed Als5. Following the discovery of amyloid formation in the Als proteins, 
Chan and Lipke made the connection that the adherence of fungal cells to surfaces is 
mediated through a process called “catch-bonding” (11). The process of catch-bonding 
seems to be broadly utilized by other organisms to mediate adhesion, as it has been 
described to occur with other systems such as mammalian selectins and bacterial adhesins 
(96). Chan and Lipke showed that the domains are activated through sheer force. The force 
causes nanodomains to form, comprising Als protein aggregates. This mechanism accounts 
for the strong adherence exhibited by C. albicans when it adheres and forms a biofilm 
compared to the relatively weak binding of adhesins to specific ligands in solution (11, 48).

The threonine-rich amyloid-forming region is followed by threonine-rich tandem repeats 
(TR). These repeats have been shown to be heavily glycosylated (84), and are predicted to 
form antiparallel β-sheets (28). Expression of Als5 derivatives that differed in the numbers 
of TR repeats in the heterologous host S. cerevisiae has shown that they mediate cell-cell 
aggregation (84). This cell-cell aggregation function was independent of the 
immunoglobulin-like domain (84). Several different modeling approaches argue that 
aggregation of the TR is mediated primarily by hydrophobic interactions (28). In addition, 
the TR region increases the affinity of the Als5 immunoglobulin-like region for at least one 
substrate, fibronectin (84). Spectroscopic analysis argues that this TR function is mediated 
by an effect on the folding of the immunoglobulin-like domain (84). It is remarkable that a 
region of such simple sequence composition can have two distinct roles in Als5 activity! It 
would be interesting to know whether the two TR functions may be separated genetically, 
and if they are both critical for biofilm formation.

There is a serine- and threonine-rich region adjacent to the TR region. Mutations that reduce 
the length of this region prevent surface exposure of S. cerevisiae-expressed Als1 (50). 
These results are consistent with detailed work on the Candida glabrata adhesin Epa1 (29), 
which revealed that lack of the corresponding region caused the adhesin to be embedded 
within the cell wall rather than surface-exposed (29). The serine-/threonine-rich regions of

several other C. albicans adhesins, Eap1 and members of the Hyr/Iff family, are also 
required for surface exposure (8, 46). Thus the function of this region, to enable surface 
exposure of N-terminal ligand-binding domain, seems to be similar among many different 
adhesin-like proteins. This region is sometimes called the stalk, a name that seems to reflect 
function quite well.

At the very C-terminus of Als proteins (and many other cell wall proteins) is a short 
hydrophobic peptide that serves as a GPI-anchor addition signal. The GPI anchor, which is 
added in the endoplasmic reticulum, possesses a lipid tail that serves as a membrane tether. 
Upon trafficking to the cell surface, some GPI-anchored proteins remain tethered to the 
outer face of the plasma membrane, whereas others are transferred to become covalently 
linked to cell wall β-1,6 glucan (76). In C. albicans (51), as in S. cerevisiae (36), amino acid 
residues neighboring the GPI-anchor addition site determine whether the protein becomes 
localized primarily to the plasma membrane or cell wall. Beyond this generic function for 
the GPI-anchor addition signal, Ahmad et al. have provided evidence that this region 
influences the affinity of Als5 for its ligands (1). However, the study used recombinant 
proteins, and it will be exciting if this function can be demonstrated in live fungal cells. In 
general, the most broadly documented function for the GPI-anchor addition signal is to 
mediate cell wall attachment of adhesins and other mannoproteins (76).

How can you determine if a protein functions as an adhesin? Various approaches have been 
used to answer this question. One way to show adhesive function is to express the protein in 
a non-adherent organism. Fanning and colleagues utilized a bcr1Δ/Δ
albicans that is defective in expression of most known adhesins including Als1 and Hwp1 
(22). Therefore, this strain does not adhere to surfaces under a variety of conditions. By 
overexpressing various genes of interest, Fanning et al. showed that several known adhesins 
(Als1, Als4, Als2) restored adherence in a bcr1Δ/Δ

 mutant strain of C. 

 mutant.

The model yeast S. cerevisiae, like the C. albicans bcr1Δ/Δ
 mutant, does not adhere well to 
many surfaces. Therefore, it has been widely used as a heterologous expression system for 
assessing adhesive protein function. Als1, Als3, Eap1, Hwp1, and Rbt1 have each been 
heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae and shown to be functional adhesins (30, 32, 67). 
The S. cerevisiae cells expressing these proteins attached and formed biofilms on abiotic and 
cellular substrates, albeit to varying degrees (30, 32, 67). Using S. cerevisiae to express C. 
albicans proteins is an effective way to reduce the redundancy of adhesins and other 
adherence mechanisms that are utilized by C. albicans cells. However, it is important to note 
that C. albicans translates the CUG codon as serine, while most other organisms including S. 
cerevisiae translate CUG as leucine (90). This coding difference may cause unintended 
structural consequences if the protein is not codon optimized.

Biofilm integrity probably depends upon a balance of cell-substrate adherence and cell-cell 
adherence (sometimes called cohesion (97)). The importance of this balance was 
emphasized in studies of Cabral et al. of a panel of C. albicans strains that overexpressed 
531 different individual genes, including many cell wall protein genes (10). They made the 
perplexing observation that overexpression of certain cell wall proteins affected a strain’s 
ability to form biofilms differentially, based on whether the biofilm was a mono-culture or

multi-strain biofilm (10). For example, when cell wall genes were overexpressed in a pooled 
biofilm assay of 531 strains, the PGA22-overexpressing strain had increased abundance 
compared to other strains. However, when the strain was grown in a single strain biofilm 
assay, the PGA22-overexpressing strain showed decreased biomass. The study found that 
overexpression of PGA22 in C. albicans or a PGA22-derived hybrid gene in S. cerevisiae 
augmented cell-cell adhesion, and the resulting clumps of cells had incresased sensitivity to 
shear force (10). Therefore, the flow conditions under which these biofilm assays were 
conducted could remove exposed cell aggregates in single-strain biofilms, but could not 
dislodge the PGA22-overexpressing cells that were shielded by their 531 cousins in mixed-
strain biofilms. This imaginative study illustrates both the importance of a balance of 
adhesion to cells and substrates, as well as the act that cell-cell interactions within a biofilm 
can allow increased cell diversity.

The mold pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus also forms adhesive biofilms, though many of its 
properties are quite different from C. albicans. Biofilm formation in A. fumigatus occurs in 
vitro when grown under static aerial conditions or when grown attached to human bronchial 
epithelial cells. The biofilm is characterized by a mat of hyphae, encased in extracellular 
matrix and shows increased resistance to antifungal cells compared to planktonic cells (57, 
92). For biofilms to form, these infections first begin with inhaled conidia that adhere to 
bronchial epithelial cells or macrophages. A. fumigatus RodA was discovered as a 
hydrophobin – a surface protein that confers hydrophobicity – that is expressed on conidia 
(101). A rodA mutant was shown to have decreased adhesion, but was dispensable for 
virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection (101). Similarly, CalA, a predicted adhesin 
was shown to bind mouse lung cells and laminin (104). However, its role in virulence or 
biofilm formation remains to be determined. Current understanding of A. fumigatus biofilms 
suggests that an extracellular matrix component, discussed in the next section, may have a 
more significant role in biofilm formation than any cell wall proteins.

Extracellular matrix material

One of the hallmarks of all biofilms is the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) (21, 38). 
The ECM can have diverse functions, including surface adherence, cell-cell aggregation, and 
nutrient storage (25). Of special relevance to biofilm infections, ECM can present a barrier 
that buffers biofilm cells from antimicrobial agents as well as host defenses (14, 20).

ECM has been characterized from biofilms of several Candida species (summarized in (18)). 
We focus here on two species, C. albicans and A. fumigatus, whose ECM has been studied 
in detail. We note that ECM abundance and composition can vary considerably with growth 
conditions (53), as does biofilm structure itself (Figure 1B), so some conclusions may differ 
between studies because of use of distinct media.

Initial characterization of the C. albicans ECM through chemical analysis revealed the 
presence of glucose, hexosamine, protein, extracellular DNA (eDNA), and a few other 
components (4). This analysis was complemented through functional assays for biofilm 
integrity and adherence after enzymatic hydrolysis of ECM components (2). Overall biofilm

integrity was found to depend upon multiple ECM components, including β-1,3 glucan, 
chitin, protein, and eDNA.

Are there unique proteins in the ECM? A combination of electrophoretic separation and 
mass spectrometry identified abundant C. albicans biofilm matrix proteins, and compared 
them to planktonic culture supernatant proteins (102). There was good correspondence 
between the samples, which included both conventionally secreted proteins, which have an 
N-terminal signal sequence, and unconventionally secreted proteins, which lack a signal 
sequence (54). No biofilm-specific ECM proteins were identified. Therefore, if any ECM 
proteins have unique functions in biofilm properties, these functions must arise in the 
context of ECM, perhaps as a result of high concentration or association with other ECM 
components.

The composition of C. albicans ECM has recently been defined comprehensively through a 
chemical and biochemical tour de force (110). The major components were proteins, 
carbohydrates, lipids, and eDNA. Most importantly, an abundant mannan-glucan complex 
called MGCx (which might be pronounced “Magic X”) was identified. It comprised 
branched β-1,6 mannan complexed with linear β-1,6 glucan. Because this complex is 
present at low levels if at all in cell wall preparations, it cannot arise from inadvertent 
contamination of ECM with cell wall fragments. In fact, MGCx may be the first C. albicans 
biofilm-specific marker.

How might an ECM-specific marker like MGCx be assembled? A fascinating answer comes 
from a study in which candidate genes were used to make mutants defective in individual 
ECM carbohydrate components (56). One surprising result was that accumulation of three 
ECM carbohydrates - mannan, β-1,3 glucan, and β-1,6 glucan - is coordinated: mutations 
that reduce accumulation of one component generally reduce accumulation of all three. The 
most intriguing finding was that mixed biofilms comprising mutants blocked in production 
of different carbohydrate components displayed extracellular complementation, 
accumulating all components at levels as great or greater than the wild type. These findings 
indicate that ECM is assembled extracellularly (56). Perhaps the high local concentrations in 
the biofim of substrates and enzymes for ECM assembly enable the reactions to proceed 
more rapidly than in the relatively dilute supernatant of a planktonic culture.

A second important finding from the comprehensive ECM analysis came from proteomic 
studies of biofilms formed in vivo in animal infection models (110). Specifically, although 
ECM from in vitro biofilms had 565 different C. albicans proteins, ECM from in vivo 
biofilm models (venous catheter, urinary catheter, and denture) had only 16 C. albicans 
proteins. The vast majority of ECM proteins found in vivo were from the host. Therefore, 
host proteins may make unique functional contributions to the ECM from infecting biofilms. 
Interestingly, Nett et al. found a group of 14 host proteins in common among ECM samples 
from the three in vivo biofilm models (66), a very manageable number for functional 
assessments. The significance of the host protein contribution is illustrated by the fact that an 
inhibitor of C. albicans-fibronectin interaction blocks biofilm formation in vivo in a catheter 
infection model (61). These exciting findings reinforce the importance of testing conclusions

from in vitro studies in an in vivo biofilm model in order to validate their potential clinical 
significance.

A. fumigatus engages in biofilm growth during infection of the lung, where it clearly forms a 
cohesive multicellular aggregate enmeshed in ECM (6, 49). (A. fumigatus is also linked to 
some medical device-associated infections (87)). The A. fumigatus ECM comprises 
galactomannan, β-1,3 glucan, monosaccharides, polyols, melanin, and a small amount of 
protein (6). Importantly, A. fumigatus aggregates, called aspergillomas, resected from the 
lungs of patients contain both galactomannan and β-1,3 glucan, thus emphasizing the 
relevance to infection of these ECM components (49).

One of the major A. fumigatus ECM components is a polymer made of galactose and N-
acetyl-galactosamine (GAG; Galactosaminogalactan). Comparison to Aspergillus nidulans, 
which makes a GAG that is low in N-acetyl-galactosamine, argues that A. fumigatus GAG 
has a major role in promoting biofilm formation (45). GAG is localized to A. fumigatus 
germ tubes and mycelia (26), and it mediates a multitude of virulence phenotypes. For 
example, it promotes adherence to abiotic surfaces through hydrophobic interactions and has 
been shown to interact with and bind to host cells such as pneuomocytes (26). GAG also 
interacts with the immune system and is necessary for resistance to killing by neutrophil 
extracellular traps (45). There is growing evidence that C. albicans ECM also functions in 
immune evasion and manipulation of the host response (60).

A. fumigatus ECM formed in vitro has some eDNA content (80, 95). Rajendran et al. found 
that chitinase activity accumulates in mature biofilms (80), and the association of chitinase 
with autolysis (94) suggests that autolysis leads to DNA release into the ECM. In support of 
this hypothesis, addition of a chitinase inhibitor reduced ECM eDNA content (80). DNAse 
treatment disrupts A. fumigatus biofilm integrity, thus indicating that eDNA plays a 
structural role in this species’ biofilm (80).

Dispersed cells

Dispersion is an important step in the developmental cycle of biofilm formation. The 
propagation of new biofilms necessitates the release and dispersal of new cells, due to the 
fact that fungi are non-motile. Uppuluri et al. measured the kinetics of dispersion of C. 
albicans cells using a flow biofilm model to mimic in vivo conditions where blood or other 
fluids create flow over implanted medical devices (105). They showed that even at early time 
points in biofilm formation, cells were being dispersed from the biofilm. Logically, the 
released cells were not comprised of true hyphae, but the vast majority of cells were 
polarized yeast-form cells. Although dispersed cells were predominantly yeast, the cells 
showed unique phenotypic properties such as increased adhesion compared to planktonic 
yeast cells. The dispersed cells also displayed increased virulence in a mouse model of 
disseminated candidiasis. This implies that the dispersed cells represent a distinct class of 
cell type in C. albicans.

Environmental signals can impact dispersion. Uppuluri showed that the amount of cell 
dispersion positively correlated with the amount of glucose in the media (105).

Understanding the circumstances under which cells are most likely to be released from a 
biofilm and enter a patient’s bloodstream could be important for clinical applications. 
Similarly, preventing dispersal of these highly virulent cells could be a way to combat 
systemic fungal infections caused by biofilms on implanted medical devices. In that context, 
promoter shut-off experiments have identified four regulators - Ume6, Pes1, Nrg1, and 
Hsp90 - that govern cell dispersion from pre-formed biofilms (87, 105, 106). In addition, 
defects in a histone deacetylase complex encoded by HOS2, SIF2, SNT1, and SET2 reduce 
the abundance of dispersed cells (69). These regulators of the genes they control may be 
useful pharmacological targets for limiting biofilm accumulation.

Drug resistance and persistence

All biofilms are notorious for their resistance to antimicrobial drugs and antiseptics, and C. 
albicans biofilms are no exception. One of the most careful comparisons of resistance of C. 
albicans biofilm and planktonic cells, in the same assay format, comes from the pioneering 
studies of Hawser and Douglas (39). They observed that biofilm growth conferred 5- to 7-
fold greater tolerance to amphotericin B, flucytosine, or several azoles. Time course studies 
of Chandra et al. revealed that C. albicans biofilms develop resistance to amphotericin B, 
fluconazole, and other treatments rapidly - between 2 and 12 hr after initiation of biofilm 
formation (12). How does biofilm resistance arise? Our current understanding is that several 
mechanisms contribute to this phenotype, which makes it robust and quite consistent among 
different C. albicans isolates and Candida species (39).

One factor that contributes to resistance is the up-regulation of drug efflux pump genes 
CDR1, CDR2 and MDR1 early in biofilm development (58, 81). Mutant analysis indicates 
that these genes have measurable impact on fluconazole resistance early in biofilm 
formation. As biofilms mature, though, other mechanisms make more prominent 
contributions to resistance.

A second factor is the presence of extracellular matrix material. One of the functional matrix 
constituents is DNA: it contributes to resistance to amphotericin B and caspofungin, as 
shown by the increased susceptibility of biofilm cells after DNAse treatment (52). 
Interestingly, the treatment did not affect fluconazole susceptibility, thus indicating that 
overall biofilm properties were not disrupted by the treatment. The mechanism by which 
matrix extracellular DNA confers resistance is not known. Soluble β-1,3 glucan is a second 
functional matrix constituent; it has a major role in biofilm azole resistance, as shown by 
Nett and colleagues through engineering altered expression of the β-1,3 glucan synthase 
gene FKS1 (64). They observed that changes in FKS1 expression were accompanied by 
corresponding changes in soluble β-1,3 glucan in the matrix. The phenotypic impact was 
dramatic: reductions in FKS1 expression yielded biofilms that were extremely fluconazole-
sensitive. The effect was biofilm-specific, in that the same strains were unaffected in 
fluconazole sensitivity during planktonic growth (64). Direct binding assays revealed that 
soluble β-1,3 glucan binds directly to fluconazole, thus indicating that drug sequestration is 
the mechanistic basis for biofilm fluconazole resistance (64). A follow-up study of candidate 
genes showed that three genes, BGL2, PHR1, and XOG1 also govern fluconazole 
susceptibility and matrix β-1,3 glucan production (100). These three genes specify

therapeutics that might be combined with fluconazole.

Another biofilm feature that contributes to the resilience of biofilms against antifungals is 
the presence of persister cells. Persister cells are a distinct portion of dormant cells in a 
genetically identical population that can survive concurrent lethal rounds of antimicrobial 
treatments (5). Candida albicans persister cells are unique in that they only form when 
grown in a biofilm (43); bacterial persister cells have been shown to form during both 
stationary phase and biofilm growth. This implies a distinct mechanism underlying 
persistence formation for fungal cells. When treated with amphotericin B or chlorhexidine, 
Candida albicans cells grown to stationary or exponential phase are killed efficiently, but 
when the cells are grown as a biofilm they show a distinct biphasic curve of killing. 
Interestingly, efg1Δ/Δ
formation, still formed persister cells at consistent levels. This suggests that the mechanism 
regarding persistence formation is independent of formation of a normal biofilm; evidence 
points to the idea that attachment to a surface may be sufficient to induce persister formation 
(43). Additionally, the phenomenon of persister cells in Candida infections was shown to be 
clinically relevant through the screening of 22 patients that presented with long-term 
Candida infections. Perplexingly, the C. galbrata strains that were recovered showed low 
levels of persister formation. On the other hand, the C. albicans isolates formed high levels 
of persister cells (44).

One clue into the genetic basis of persister cells in Candida albicans comes from Bink et al. 
(7), who showed that SOD (superoxide dismutase) mutants generate lower percentages of 
persister cells when treated with miconazole. SODs function by converting ROS (reactive 
oxygen species) to O2- thereby detoxifying the ROS. The reduction in persister cell 
formation was only true when using the antifungal miconazole, which had been shown to 
raise ROS levels in cells. However, these mutants did not completely eradicate the persister 
cells, so undoubtedly there is still research to be done to understand the genetic regulation of 
this phenomenon.

Gene Expression

There has been long-standing interest in identification of genes that are induced during 
biofilm formation. Such genes were thought to be - and have proven to be! - enriched for 
genes that contribute to biofilm formation, and can be informative in terms of broader 
biological processes that are biofilm-relevant. As such, biofilm-associated genes can reveal 
the identities of major regulatory systems and environmental signals that act during biofilm 
formation. Below we call these genes “biofilm-associated genes” because they have been 
defined through many different kinds of comparisons. Any one particular comparison may 
yield a distinctive set of genes that are up-regulated in biofilm cells.

Is there a fundamental biofilm-associated gene expression pattern? There have been a few 
different approaches to this problem. Garcia-Sanchez et al. profiled biofilm cells grown 
under diverse conditions in comparison to planktonic cells also grown under diverse 
conditions (31). They arrived at a set of 325 genes (out of only 2002 represented on their

microarrays) whose differential expression was characteristic of biofilm cells from multiple 
comparisons; 214 genes were up-regulated in biofilms. These 214 genes were enriched in 
transcription and translation genes as well as biosynthetic genes for amino acids, 
polyamines, nucleotides, and lipids. Up-regulation of numerous translation-associated genes 
in biofilm cells was also observed in a comparison that looked for shared gene expression 
features among two different wild-type strains, SC5314 and WO-1 (17). These findings 
argue that biofilm growth enables cellular biogenesis to occur over a prolonged period 
compared to planktonic growth in the same medium. A simple explanation is that a biofilm 
may capture excreted metabolites, thus facilitating their utilization when preferred 
metabolites are exhausted.

Many studies have reported that hyphal genes are up-regulated in biofilms compared to 
planktonic cells (59, 70, 109). Garcia-Sanchez et al. had filtered those genes out by design 
through inclusion of a nonfilamentous mutant grown under biofilm and planktonic 
conditions (31); it was discovered that the mutant had the novel ability to form a biofilm on 
a glass surface. However, in the RNA-Seq biofilm-planktonic comparison of both SC5314 
and WO-1, down-regulation of hyphal genes was consistently observed in biofilm cells (17). 
The biofilm time-course analysis of Fox et al. (27) may explain these disparate results: at 
early times, hyphal genes were up-regulated in biofilm cells, but at later times, they were 
down-regulated, relative to planktonic hyphae. Perhaps sufficiently high concentrations of 
quorum sensing molecules such as farnesol accumulate in mature biofilms (42, 82), 
inhibiting hyphal growth and hyphal gene expression at late times.

How do gene expression features compare between biofilms grown in vitro and in vivo? 
Profiling of C. albicans catheter biofilms by Nett et al. (63) reveals some consistent 
responses. Specifically, amino acid biosynthetic genes and transcription/translation genes 
were up-regulated in biofilm cells in vivo. In addition, numerous transporters were up-
regulated, thus suggesting that biofilm cells may be limited for nutrients. The study 
compared biofilm cells to planktonic hyphae, a likely basis for the failure to detect up-
regulation of hyphal-associated genes in biofilm cells. Overall, then, the correlations among 
broad trends in gene expression indicate that in vitro-grown biofilms serve as a useful model 
for catheter biofilms that form in vivo.

Have biofilm-associated genes been validated functionally? In other words, is gene 
regulation a predictor of gene function? One approach is to use biofilm-associated gene 
properties to deduce biofilm-relevant regulatory pathways. This approach was implemented 
by the d’Enfert lab in their initial study of biofilm gene expression (31). Because many 
amino acid biosynthetic genes were up-regulated in biofilm cells, they inferred that the 
general amino acid control regulator, Gcn4, may be critical for biofilm formation. Indeed, 
they observed that a gcn4Δ/Δ
biomass compared to the wild-type strain (31). Another illustration of this kind of thinking 
comes from the observation that biofilm-associated gene expression resembles the response 
to hypoxia (88), an observation first reported for Candida parapsilosis. That observation 
suggests that a mutant defective in hypoxic regulation may be defective in biofilm 
formation. Indeed, Bonhomme et al. found that Tye7, a transcription factor required for the 
hypoxic response (88), is required for many features of C. albicans biofilms (9). A third 

 mutant produced a defective biofilm, one with reduced

example comes from the point raised above that hyphal-associated genes have often been 
observed to be up-regulated in biofilms (depending on the specific biofilm-planktonic 
comparison). That observation makes sense because hyphae are a prominent feature of C. 
albicans biofilms grown under almost any condition, and suggests that mutants defective in 
expression of hyphal-associated genes will be defective in biofilm formation. That prediction 
has turned out to be correct time and again (33, 34, 70, 83). Therefore, inferences from 
biofilm profiling data about biofilm-relevant regulatory pathways has proven successful in 
terms of functional validation.

The second approach to functional validation is to determine whether each specific biofilm-
associated gene has a measurable function in biofilm formation. Here the results have been 
mixed, though there may be some useful lessons for the future. The initial study of this kind, 
from the d’Enfert group, examined deletion mutants of 38 biofilm-associated genes for 
defects in biofilm biomass or hyphal morphogenesis (9). The genes had been chosen based 
on the magnitude of their up-regulation in biofilms after elimination of likely essential genes 
and members of gene families. Eight of the 38 mutants produced biofilms with moderately 
reduced biomass but had no planktonic growth defect; one mutant had severely reduced 
biofilm biomass and a severe planktonic growth defect. On its face, the results were slightly 
disappointing because the yield of biofilm-defective mutants was low, and because the 
biofilm-defective mutants identified had mild defects. In a related approach, Desai et al. 
focused on genes that were up-regulated in biofilms of two different clinical C. albicans 
isolates (17). Of 62 most highly up-regulated genes, viable insertion mutants could be 
isolated for 25 genes. The mutants were screened for a panel of biofilm-related phenotypes, 
including biofilm formation, drug tolerance, quorum-sensing signaling, and others. Most of 
these mutants, 20 of 25, had significant defects in at least one biofilm-related phenotype. 
The high yield of biofilm-relevant phenotypes in this study may have reflected both the gene 
selection criteria as well as the range and sensitivity of the phenotypic assays.

The validation approaches and results presented above apply to in vitro-grown biofilms. 
However, the specific in vitro conditions used can have dramatic effects on biofilm 
properties (15, 97), and some mutations cause a biofilm defect only under a subset of in vitro 
conditions (85). In fact, one theme that has emerged repeatedly in all aspects of infection 
biology is that in vitro conditions can be poor mimics of in vivo conditions. Hence the key 
validation approach in our view is to determine whether a biofilm-associated gene can be 
shown to function in an animal model of biofilm infection. The most frequently used model 
is a rat venous catheter biofilm model (3). Several mutant strains have similar biofilm 
defects in vitro and in vivo (17, 24, 62, 68, 70, 74, 87, 100). However, there are examples in 
which the severity of a mutant defect is much greater in vitro than in a catheter model in 
vivo, and vice versa (17, 23, 70, 73). It would accelerate biofilm research considerably if 
there existed an in vitro model that could accurately predict in vivo outcomes.

Biofilm gene regulation

It has proven useful to identify biofilm regulators for three main reasons. First, because a 
single transcription factor often controls many functionally related target genes, a single 
biofilm-defective transcription factor mutant can lead to discovery of many biofilm-relevant

genes among the target genes that it regulates. One of the initial illustrations of this principle 
came from studies of the S. cerevisiae mating type locus, which specifies master regulators 
whose target genes confer individual cell type-specific properties (40). Second, there are 
many examples in which a transcription factor mutant has a more prominent phenotype than 
mutants defective in individual target genes of the transcription factor. A simple illustration 
comes again from studies of S. cerevisiae, this time of meiosis and spore formation: many 
mutations that caused a prominent sporulation defect affected meiotic regulators rather than 
the machinery that mediated specific meiotic events (55). This outcome could reasonably be 
considered a result of the first principle. Third, some biofilm regulators identified in C. 
albicans have orthologs in other Candida species that also govern biofilm formation 
(discussed below). Hence a biofilm regulator can provide an entry point for definition of 
biofilm-relevant genes and biological processes in many organisms.

The transcription factors that control biofilm formation have been identified through several 
approaches. One approach is deductive logic based upon expression profiling or other 
biofilm features, as discussed above (9, 33, 34, 83). A second approach is to screen a set of 
transcription factor mutants for defects in biofilm formation or related phenotypes. For 
example, panels of both insertion and deletion mutants have been screened for failure to 
form biofilms (27, 70, 72). An elegant variation on this approach was to assay mutants at 
several time points in biofilm formation (27). Another related screen was for mutants that 
were defective in adherence to a silicone substrate (23). Overall, 51 transcription factor 
genes have been shown to affect biofilm-related properties in these large-scale screens as 
well as more focused studies (33, 71).

These studies have revealed that there is a major biofilm regulatory network, sometimes 
called the “core network” (71), comprising transcriptional regulators of hyphal 
morphogenesis and hyphal genes. These transcription factors include Flo8, Rfx2, Gal4 (27), 
Brg1, Bcr1, Rob1, Efg1, Ndt80, and Tec1 (70, 72, 83). These transcription factors are 
functionally interconnected, in that each binds to at least one other network regulator’s 
upstream region and regulates its expression (27, 70). Rfx2 and Gal4 are negative regulators 
of biofilm formation; the respective null mutations cause increased biofilm formation (27), 
and, for Rfx2, an increase in expression of many hyphal genes (37). The other transcription 
factors in this network are positive regulators of biofilm formation; null mutations cause 
reduced biofilm formation and reduced expression of hyphal genes (27, 70, 72, 83). For 
many of the positive regulators in this network, current evidence indicates that adhesin genes 
ALS1, ALS3, and HWP1 are critical downstream target genes, because overexpression of 
one of these genes can restore considerable biofilm formation (68, 70, 111). However, there 
are likely to be additional network target genes that contribute to biofilm formation, because 
phenotypic rescue by adhesin overexpression is only partial in some cases (70). In fact, there 
are 21 transcription factor genes whose 5′ regions are bound by one or more network 
regulators, and that govern biofilm-relevant phenotypes (AHR1, BPR1, CAS5, CRZ2, 
CZF1, FCR3, GCN4, GRF10, GZF3, MSS11, NRG1, RFG1, RIM101, TRY4, TRY5, TRY6, 
TYE7, UME6, ZAP1, ZCF31, and ZCF8) (33, 71). Hence this regulatory network controls 
adhesins and, potentially, many additional diverse biofilm properties.

Are all biofilm properties under control of this core network? It is not clear as of yet. There 
are 21 transcriptional regulatory genes that control biofilm formation or biofilm-relevant 
properties, including ACE2, ADA2, ARG81, DAL81, FGR27, LEU3, MET4, NOT3, RLM1, 
SNF5, SUC1, TAF14, TRY2, TRY3, UGA33, WAR1, ZCF28, ZCF34, ZCF39, ZFU2, and 
ZNC1 (71). These regulators govern such properties as the level of extracellular matrix (65) 
or the adherence of yeast-form cells (23). These features could conceivably be regulated 
independently of hyphal adhesins. Whether they are regulated through the core network is an 
interesting question for future studies.

Have we found all of the biofilm regulators? One could reasonably argue that 51 regulators 
are enough! We suspect that there are others, though, and that they are worth studying. We 
think that there are others worth studying because of the in vitro-in vivo differences 
mentioned earlier in this chapter. Specifically, our lab has identified transcription factors that 
are required for biofilm formation in vivo, but not in vitro (23). Thus we hypothesize that the 
systematic screens used thus far may have overlooked other transcription factors with these 
properties. Perhaps they could be identified through application of the elegant mutant pool 
screens used by Noble (75) to assay in vivo biofilm formation assays.

Conserved features

Are there conserved features among biofilms of different Candida species? There are 
certainly some conserved features, even though the biofilm architecture of each species has 
been shown to vary. Several researchers have investigated this question of conservation by 
comparing C. albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilms. Evidence suggests that the major 
regulators of biofilm formation are conserved both species. This may come as a surprise, 
because C. parapsilosis does not form true hyphae. Ding et al. (19) showed that the 
transcription factor, Bcr1, is a major regulator of biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis, 
comparable to C. albicans. Also, some downstream targets of Bcr1 are conserved between 
the two species. Specifically, Bcr1 was shown to regulate CFEM protein genes in both 
species. The CFEM proteins have been implicated in biofilm integrity (78, 99) in C. 
albicans, but Ding found no evidence that CFEM mutants in C. parapsilosis are defective in 
biofilm formation in vitro (19). Several CFEM proteins also function in heme iron 
acquisition (108), and their regulation by Bcr1 is consistent with the iron utilization defect of

Holland et al. was the first to make an extensive deletion collection in C. parapsilosis, which 
included homozygous deletions of 100 different genes, including many transcription factor 
genes (41). From this study, many of the phenotypes were shown to be conserved between 
C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. In the roles of biofilm formation, Efg1, Bcr1, and Ace2, 
have all been confirmed as major regulators in both Candida species. However, Holland 
found several other transcription factors (Cph2, Czf1, Gzf3, and Ume6) that played a role 
only in C. parapsilosis. Upon sequencing of the biofilm transcriptome from each species, 
Holland found that similarities between the two species clustered around genes involved 
with metabolism (41). Similarly, when biofilms of both species were grown under hypoxic 
conditions, there was good correlation between the two transcriptional profiles (88). For

example, Upc2 is required in both species for regulation of egosterol biosynthesis genes 
during hypoxia (35). It seems that the transcriptional landscape of biofilm formation in C. 
albicans and C. parapsilosis may be broadly conserved, but with some distinct divergences 
among regulators.

Conclusion

Inspection of the inside out biofilm leads to a simple question: Will a biofilm turn out to be 
simply the sum of the parts? It is almost certainly not the sum of the parts that we know at 
this time. We still have limited understanding of the drivers and determinants of cell 
heterogeneity, as well as the flip side of heterogeneity, which is cell-cell cooperation. 
Biofilms, like tissues, present a considerable systems-level challenge. We often conceive of 
the collection of genes that govern biofilm formation as a network that acts within a single 
cell, much like the systems-level view of S. cerevisiae. However, consideration of cell 
heterogeneity makes a compelling case to us that there are many different networks active 
among the diverse cells of a biofilm.

An additional challenge that underlies the sum-of-the-parts question is that our biofilm parts 
list is incomplete. One reason it is incomplete is because our in vitro biofilm models fail to 
recapitulate many features of in vivo-grown biofilms, hence mutant phenotypes differ in 
vitro and in vivo. In fact, each kind of biofilm – venous catheter, mucosal, etc. – is likely to 
reflect a distinct balance of biofilm phenotypes and regulatory inputs. Going forward, it 
seems imperative to validate experimental results with in vivo models in order to see which 
biofilm determinants are most relevant to infection biology.

Despite those challenges, a brief reflection on the history of fungal biofilm research 
underscores our optimism and excitement for the future. It was only about 20 years ago that 
Julia Douglas’ lab first viewed C. albicans biology through the lens of the biofilm paradigm. 
Investigators have since elucidated the genetic and biochemical determinants of the many 
biofilm features discussed in this chapter. We now have a solid foundation from which to 
build our understanding of a fungal biofilm from the inside out.

Figure 1. Confocal imaging of C. albicans biofilms
(A) Images show the heterogeneity of biofilms at the level of gene expression using a GFP 
construct fused to the TDH3 promoter that is constitutively expressed throughout the biofilm 
and an RFP construct fused to the TYE7 promoter showing greater expression at the basal 
layer of the biofilm, respectively. (B) Images show the phenotypic diversity of biofilms 
based on the growth medium in RPMI, YPD, and RPMI plus 10% serum, respectively. 
Biofilms were fixed and imaged using a Zeiss DuoScan Confocal Microscope. Side view 
projections were generated by reslicing and then z-projecting the stack using ImageJ 
software from the National Institutes of Health.
