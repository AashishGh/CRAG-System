One sentence summary: Recalcitrance of biofilms against mechanical and chemical challenges has been looked at for ages from a microbiological
perspective, but an approach based on viscoelastic properties of biofilms yields new insights in this recalcitrance.

ABSTRACT

We summarize different studies describing mechanisms through which bacteria in a biofilm mode of growth resist
mechanical and chemical challenges. Acknowledging previous microscopic work describing voids and channels in biofilms
that govern a biofilms response to such challenges, we advocate a more quantitative approach that builds on the relation
between structure and composition of materials with their viscoelastic properties. Biofilms possess features of both
viscoelastic solids and liquids, like skin or blood, and stress relaxation of biofilms has been found to be a corollary of their
structure and composition, including the EPS matrix and bacterial interactions. Review of the literature on viscoelastic
properties of biofilms in ancient and modern environments as well as of infectious biofilms reveals that the viscoelastic
properties of a biofilm relate with antimicrobial penetration in a biofilm. In addition, also the removal of biofilm from

INTRODUCTION

Biofilms appear in many environmental settings and industrial
processes where they can appear either beneficial or detrimen-
tal (Bos, Van der Mei and Busscher 1999). Biofilms are beneficial,
for instance, to degrade environmentally hazardous substances
in soil, but detrimental on food and slaughterhouse equipment.
In many biotechnological processes, it is attempted to maintain
biofilms in order to stimulate efficient degradation of chemicals.
In the medical arena, it is currently estimated that over 60% of
all human infections treated by physicians are due to biofilms
(Fux, Costerton and Stewart 2005), examples being oral biofilms
(‘dental plaque’) and biofilms involved in a variety of patho-
logical conditions like for instance osteomyelitis, chronic otitis
media, the infected diabetic foot, chronic bacterial prostatitis
or in biomaterial-associated infections (Costerton, Stewart and
Greenberg 1999; Busscher et al., 2012). Accordingly, research is fo-
cused mostly on how to prevent and control formation of an in-
fectious, pathogenic biofilm, and on how to keep the commensal
microflora of the skin, urinary and intestinal tract or oral cavity
intact and free of potential pathogens (Reid et al., 2011).

In their biofilm mode of growth, bacteria adhering to
a substratum surface and co-adhering with each other
(Kolenbrander et al., 2010) embed themselves in a matrix
of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This matrix not
only yields bacterial phenotypes that can be different from their
planktonic counterparts, but also offers physical protection
against mechanical and chemical challenges (Flemming and
Wingender 2010).

Biofilms and mechanical challenges

Biofilm formation starts with the adhesion of bacteria to a sub-
stratum surface that can either be of biological or synthetic
origin. This layer of initially adhering bacteria provides a link
connecting other bacteria that either grow or adhere on top of
it to the substratum surface (Bos, Van der Mei and Busscher
1999). Biofilms can be mechanically challenged during growth,
for instance by water pressure in marine environments, indus-
trial pipelines or membrane filtration, in the oral cavity dur-
ing fluid flow arising from powered toothbrushing and tongue
movement, from pulsatile blood flow in intravascular catheters
or from the movement of tissues, fluid and biomaterial com-
ponents in an orthopedic joint prosthesis. When mechanical
challenges occur (Fig. 1A) and detachment forces acting on a
biofilm exceed the forces acting between different organisms
in a biofilm, the biofilm is overloaded and failure occurs in
the biofilm (‘cohesive failure’). Alternatively, when detachment
forces operate exceeding the forces by which the initially ad-
hering organisms connect with a substratum surface, the entire

resistance to environmental detachment and deformation forces. Resistance to
deformation can be a time-dependent process yielding relaxation to an original
shape over time. (B) Structure and composition govern the resistance of biofilms
against chemical challenge in combination with altered phenotypes that are in-
trinsically more resistant to antimicrobials. (C) Composition and structure are
jointly reflected in the viscoelasticity of a biofilm. Elasticity is generally pre-
sented as a spring with spring constant E, while the viscosity η (or its inverse,
the fluidity ϕ) is shown as a dashpot. Springs and dashpots can be arranged in
series (named ‘Maxwell’ element) or in parallel (called ‘Kelvin–Voigt’ element).
Springs react immediately to an applied force, while dashpots dampen the speed
of reaction. Usually, biological materials like biofilms cannot be represented by
a single combination of springs and dashpots.

ure’) (Towler et al., 2003). Often biofilms go through cycles of fluc-
tuating mechanical challenges, and cohesive or adhesive failure
along with growth occur accordingly.

chanical and chemical challenges on a more quantitative basis
than can be obtained by microscopic means. Finally, this review
identifies new pathways for the treatment of infectious bacterial
biofilms by interfering with their viscoelastic properties.

Biofilms and chemical challenges

The biofilm mode of growth protects individual bacteria from
a variety of environmental challenges, including chemically di-
verse biocides (Mah and O’Toole 2001), host immune responses
and antimicrobials (Vu et al., 2009). Poor antimicrobial penetra-
tion is the major obstacle for treating biofilm infections with
antibiotics and this has been known since Van Leeuwenhoek
(Van Leeuwenhoek 1684) reported in the 17th century that ‘the
vinegar with which I washt my teeth, kill’d only those ani-
mals which were on the outside of the scurf, but did not pass
thro the whole substance of it’. Although it has become clear
in the meantime that the protection offered by biofilms to its
inhabitants against chemical challenges consists of multiple
mechanisms working in tandem, the exact mechanism is still
not fully understood (Ito et al., 2009). In Fig. 1B, we identify
three key properties of biofilms that govern the mechanisms
through which biofilms become recalcitrant to antimicrobials
(Thomas and Nakaishi 2006; Aslam 2008; Lazar and Chifiriuc
2010; Eastman et al., 2011; Stewart 2012). Biofilm structure de-
termines many transport processes within a biofilm and can
lead to micro-environments with specific pH or nutrient avail-
ability (Koo, Falsetta and Klein 2013). Penetration of antimi-
crobials and nutrients into a biofilm depends on the degree
of channelization of the biofilm and the presence of a suit-
able medium for molecular transport through the biofilm. Usu-
ally transport of antimicrobials and nutrients is limited, based
on whether the composition of the EPS matrix and the bacte-
rial cell surfaces adsorb these compounds. Importantly, biofilm
structure is dynamic, adapting in both space and time to its
environmental conditions (Donlan 2002), amongst which are
pH, temperature, fluid shear, nutrient availability and host de-
fenses. As a result of nutrient deprivation, bacterial pheno-
types in a biofilm can alter, leading to formation of persis-
ter cells (Lopez, Vlamakis and Kolter 2010; Poole 2012) that
can remain dormant without causing disease for prolonged
periods of time. Moreover, many antimicrobial agents target
macromolecule synthesis inside bacteria (Dodds, Grobe and
Stewart 2000) during active metabolism. Thus, the presence of
a slow metabolism contributes to antimicrobial recalcitrance of
biofilms in general, and persister cells can tolerate higher con-
centrations of antimicrobials than nearby recalcitrant biofilm
organisms (Spoering and Lewis 2001; Keren et al., 2004). Con-
sequently, whereas planktonic organisms have ample access to
nutrients and, by the same token, are highly susceptible to an-
timicrobials, structural and compositional features of a biofilm
form the major impediments for nutrient deprivation, the devel-
opment of altered phenotypes and antimicrobial recalcitrance.

Aim of this review

In this review, we advocate that through a relation between
structure and composition of biofilms with their viscoelasticity
(Fig. 1C), viscoelasticity of biofilms can be recognized as a reflec-
tion of their structure and composition, including the EPS ma-
trix and bacterial interactions. Using stress relaxation analysis,
macroscopic physical properties of a biofilm can be derived that
facilitate explanation of the resistance of biofilms in ancient and
modern environments as well as of infectious biofilms to me-

VISCOELASTICTY OF NATURAL SUBSTANCES

To understand the implications of viscoelasticity as a con-
tributing factor to the resistance of biofilms to mechanical and
chemical challenges, we first give a comprehensive description
of the concept of viscoelasticity (for an excellent introduction
to biomechanics including the viscoelasticity of materials see
Vincent (2012)).

‘Viscoelasticity is a material property in which a material ex-
hibits both viscous and elastic characteristics. Viscous materi-
als deform irreversibly over time to relieve stress, while elas-
tic materials deform instantaneously to relieve stress and come
back to their original state once stress is removed. A viscoelas-
tic material will deform under stress, while returning over time
to a state similar to, but not necessarily identical to the pre-
deformed state, when stress is removed. Whereas elasticity is
usually the result of atomic or molecular stretching, viscosity is
the result of “atomic or molecular flow” (Ratner et al., 2004b)’.

Elasticity is generally presented as a spring with spring con-
stant E, while the viscosity η (or its inverse, the fluidity ϕ) is
shown as a dashpot. A spring reacts to an applied force with
an immediate change in length, depending on the magnitude of
the force applied, but this is different for a dashpot. A dashpot
behaves like a piston that is free to move up and down a cylindri-
cal vessel filled with a fluid, provided the fluid can flow through
the piston-cylinder gap. Thus, the speed at which the piston can
move heavily depends on the viscosity of the fluid. Spring and
dashpot can either be placed in series or in parallel (see Fig. 1C).
Note that biological materials usually cannot be represented by a
single combination of a spring and dashpot. Table 1 provides ex-
amples of values for the elasticity and viscosity of some known,
biological and synthetic materials, including biofilms.

VISCOELASTICITY AND BIOFILM STRUCTURE
AND COMPOSITION

Microscopic studies on biofilm structure
and composition

Microscopic techniques, and particularly confocal laser scan-
ning microscopy (CLSM), have yielded a general description of
biofilm structure and to a limited degree its microbiological
and biochemical composition. Whereas early electron micro-
scopic techniques enabled imaging of organisms in a biofilm,
the desiccation required by high-vacuum conditions has long
obscured the role of the EPS matrix that appeared as a dark rim
of condensed matter on the bacterial cell surfaces in a biofilm
(Stewart and Costerton 2001). Improved preservation methods
such as cryopreservation prevent condensation of the EPS ma-
trix (Matias et al., 2003; Schaudinn et al., 2009). Recent develop-
ment of stages and methodologies allows sequential sections
to be made and imaged. These sections can be reconstructed
into 3D volumes, providing highly detailed insights into biofilm
structure. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-
SEM), for instance, uses ion-sputtering of biofilm mass with
repetitive imaging to observe the organisms within biofilms at
high resolution (Wallace, Arey and Mahaffee 2011), and 2D im-
ages selected from a 3D image stack can be utilized to visualize

cell wall damage inside a biofilm due to antimicrobial attack (see
Fig. 2). Still, due to requirements of some degree of preservation,
these electron microscopy techniques are often susceptible to
corruption of the natural state of biofilms (Wu et al., 2014). Envi-
ronmental SEM has the advantage that it does not require dehy-
dration or fixation, but it cannot see inside the highly hydrated
EPS to reveal internal structure (Danilatos and Postle 1982;
Bridier, Meylheuc and Briandet 2013).

CLSM has become the most employed microscopy tech-
nique to study biofilms. Many key components of biofilm
structure have been determined using CLSM in association
with chemically binding fluorophores, including 3D architec-
ture (Salek, Jones and Martinuzzi 2009; Uppuluri, Chaturvedi
and Lopez-Ribot 2009; Robinson 2011), mushroom-shaped
colonies (Entcheva-Dimitrov and Spormann 2004; Venugopalan
et al., 2005), stratification (Lawrence et al., 1991), establishment
of water channels (Donlan 2002; Stewart 2012), presence of EPS
(Sanford et al., 1996; Lawrence et al., 2003; Li, Bai and Liu 2008),
bacterial cell surface damage and viability (Hope, Clements and
Wilson 2002) as well as biofilm failure under compression (Cense
et al., 2006). The establishment of water channels, however, has
never been directly proven by CLSM methods, but rather in-
directly indicated by the absence of stain uptake as by bac-

teria and matrix components. Chemically reactive lectins pro-
vide information about the molecular composition of sugars
within a biofilm (Allison 2003). Alternatively, fluorescent in situ
hybridization (better known by its abbreviation ‘FISH’) differen-
tially stains individual cells of different bacterial species, provid-
ing information about the location of different species within
multispecies biofilms (Weber et al., 2007). CLSM also has the
advantage of allowing real-time imaging of localized processes
of attachment, growth and dispersal as well as metabolic activ-
ity and flow through the biofilm. A limiting factor in the use of
CLSM is that the penetration ability of the fluorophores is typ-
ically confined to 20 to 40 μm (Vroom et al., 1999), and it is dif-
ficult to see much deeper within a biofilm structure. Moreover,
the penetration capability of the laser itself limits the depth of
view within a biofilm structure. Two-photon laser systems have
helped to increase the penetration depth of the CLSM imag-
ing, yet they still require the use of fluorophores that may have
harmful effects to the biofilms (Mclean, Ona and Majors 2008).

These drawbacks of CLSM have stimulated the use of other
microscopic techniques that image biofilm structure but do not
rely on staining. Optical coherence tomography, for instance, re-
lies on the scattering of light rather than on fluorescent stain-
ing and is used to accurately describe voids and water channels

238

(Wagner et al., 2010). Water channels have been indirectly indi-
cated by CLSM methods, assuming that they correspond with
voids, but CLSM easily overestimates the presence of voids, be-
cause they also appear due to lack of stain penetration. Opti-
cal coherence tomography, not relying on stain penetration, has
demonstrated that heterotrophic biofilms had a porosity un-
der 70%, when 98% porosity was found using CLSM (Wagner
et al., 2010).

In summary, advances in microscopic imaging techniques
have yielded structural information on voids and water chan-
nels in biofilms and their compositional heterogeneity. However,
in essence, these advances still reflect a similar conclusion as
drawn in the 17th century, when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek re-
ported on the poor penetration of vinegar into oral biofilm us-
ing his first, self-made microscopes (Van Leeuwenhoek 1684).
This calls for an urgent need for more quantitative, observer-
independent techniques to characterize biofilms in terms of
structure and composition. One such alternative technique cen-
ters on biofilm viscoelasticity.

Measurement of the viscoelasticity of biofilms

Measurement of the viscoelasticity of a biofilm either involves
measuring deformation under constant stress (‘creep’) (Lau
et al., 2009) in either a compressive, shear or tensile mode or
measuring the stress required to maintain a constant deforma-
tion (‘stress relaxation’) (Cense et al., 2006), as summarized in
Fig. 3A and B. Constant mechanical stress or deformation (of-
ten reported as ‘strain’) can, amongst other methods, be ap-
plied by uniaxial compression (K ¨orstgens et al., 2001), in which a
macroscopic plunger mechanically stresses or deforms the
biofilm and strain or stress relaxation is recorded as a function
of time. Since relaxation results from multiple re-arrangement
processes in a deformed biofilm, the mathematical description
of relaxation possesses multiple elements. Although creep is
the increase of strain under an imposed load and stress relax-
ation is the dissipation of stress under an imposed strain (Gupta
et al., 2010), their measurement can be analyzed using similar
mathematical models, which result in similar time constants
of their response processes (Poznanski, Pawlowski and Fikus
1992). Generally, due to its multi-component nature, stress re-
laxation of biofilms can be described by three to four Maxwell
or Kelvin–Voigt elements (see Fig. 1C) with each element con-
taining a dashpot, responsible of a single time-dependent
re-arrangement process, combined with a spring constant,
representing the immediate elastic response. Note that in a
Kelvin–Voigt element, dashpot and spring are placed in paral-
lel, causing dampening of the immediate response as immedi-
ate relaxation has to occur against the action of the dashpot. In a
Maxwell model (Fig. 3C), multiple Maxwell elements are placed
in parallel, while in a Burgers model a Kelvin–Voigt element is
placed between the spring and dashpot of a Maxwell element
(Fig. 3D). However, the more elements one includes, the better
the fit but the more uncertainty in the values of the param-
eters derived will occur. The creep response commonly found
in biofilms may require a minimum of four elements (Jones
et al., 2011).

Using microbead atomic force microscopy, relaxation pro-
cesses in a biofilm can also be monitored on a more microscopic
level (Lau et al., 2009). Often, the microbead is comprised of a sil-
ica particle with a diameter typically in the order of up to 50 μm.
Stress deformation of Pseudomonas biofilms using microbead
atomic force microscopy yielded relaxation times of less than
1 s, with a reduced viscoelastic response in more matured

Figure 3. Viscoelastic measurements of ‘creep’ and ‘stress relaxation’. (A) Dur-
ing creep measurements, a constant stress is induced while the deformation of
the biofilm is recorded over time. (B) During stress relaxation measurements, a
constant deformation is induced and the stress required to maintain that defor-
mation is recorded over time. (C) In a Maxwell model, response to an induced
stress or deformation is mathematically modeled using multiple Maxwell el-
ements in parallel, each with their characteristic time constants representing
the viscous part of the response (‘the dashpots’, ηn) and an immediate elastic
response component (‘the springs’, En). Characteristics time constants of each
individual response process follow from τ n as indicated in the graph. (D) In a
Burger’s model, this response is mathematically modeled using a Kelvin–Voigt
element separated by a spring and dashpot, that together represent a Maxwell
element.

biofilms of Pseudomonas strains deficient in lipopolysaccha-
rides. Individual bonds between single bacteria are also vis-
coelastic in nature and bacterial probe atomic force microscopy
has revealed relaxation times for a variety of Gram-negative bac-
terial strains between 0.8 and 2.6 s based on a three-element
standard solid model (Vadillo-Rodriguez and Dutcher 2011).
Relaxation times of Gram-positive staphylococcal bonds were
slightly higher between 1 and 6 s and shorter in absence of an
EPS matrix around the bacteria (Chen et al., 2014).

While indentation and rheometry measure bulk properties of
biofilms, microscopy-based techniques can be utilized to mea-
sure local viscoelastic properties within a biofilm and in dif-
ferent biofilm structures. Digital image correlation of 2D bright
field microscope images of biofilms grown under flow revealed
that biofilm deforms differently in response to elevations in fluid
shear in the attached head as compared to in the streamer tail
(Mathias and Stoodley 2009). More recently microrheometry us-
ing CLSM to track the motion of magnetic beads in response
to an oscillating magnetic field (Galy et al., 2012) or the natural
brownian motion of beads within the biofilm (Chew et al., 2014)
have been used to map the viscoelastic properties of biofilms at

specific locations in 3D. Galy et al. (2012) found that some parts
of a biofilm behave like elastic solids, while others behave more
like viscoelastic liquids and the base of the biofilm was stiffer
than the upper layers, illustrating the importance of mechani-
cal heterogeneity. It was also reported that the local mechanical
properties were not related to local cell density, suggesting that
the EPS was the principal determinant. Chew et al. (2014) were
able to link the mechanical properties of different polymers ex-
pressed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with streamer forma-
tion. Optical coherence tomography also has good potential for
measuring 3D biofilm structural responses to applied fluid shear
stresses (Wagner et al., 2010). The difficulty in simulating in situ
biofilm rheological behavior in the laboratory using pure pro-
tein and polysaccharide gels suggests that the rheological com-
plexity is a result of structural and compositional heterogeneity
within a biofilm. The measurement of relaxation processes at a
more microscopic level combined with local staining of specific
EPS components offers the challenging possibility of modeling
the macroscopic viscoelasticity of a biofilm in terms of its EPS
response and the response of individually interacting bacteria.

Association between viscoelastic properties
with structure and composition of biofilms

Bacteria in a biofilm constitute the heaviest masses; thus,
their re-arrangement upon an induced deformation will be
slow, and the relative importance of the slowest Maxwell ele-
ment in relaxation has been intuitively associated with bacte-
rial re-arrangement in a biofilm. Recently, the relatively slow
re-arrangement of P. aeruginosa was confirmed by direct micro-
scopic observation of relaxation processes, showing that bacte-
ria could not find new, stable positions within 100 s upon an im-
posed deformation (Peterson et al., 2014), while EPS displaced by
deformation moved toward deeper layers within 20 s. In the so-
called ‘fluctuating binding point model’ (K ¨orstgens et al., 2001),
this implies that binding points in a biofilm, existing prior to the
application of deformation, can be more readily re-established
between EPS components than between bacteria or between
bacteria with EPS components. Water, on the other hand, has the
lowest viscosity in a biofilm, and therefore the fastest Maxwell
element has been associated with the flow of water through
a compressed biofilm. This leaves an association between the
behavior of EPS with intermediate Maxwell element(s) (Peter-
son et al., 2012; He et al., 2013). Principal component analyses of
Maxwell elements describing the stress relaxation exhibited by
biofilms with different matrix chemistries have pointed out that
in general three principal components suffice to describe stress
relaxation of biofilms (Peterson et al., 2013). The fastest principal
component was associated with the outflow of water and solu-
ble polysaccharides. A second principal component was associ-
ated with the EPS matrix as a whole, with a distinct impact of
the presence of eDNA included in a third component, possess-
ing a narrowly confined time constant range within the range of
the second principal component. The presence of bacteria them-
selves as the heaviest masses is included in the first principal
component with an inverse impact of bacterial prevalence with
respect to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, i.e.
the free space in a biofilm available for bacterial re-arrangement
processes (Peterson et al., 2013). Importantly, herewith there ex-
ists a relation between quantifiable viscoelastic properties of a
biofilm that relates with their structure and composition that
goes beyond the possibilities of microscopic imaging techniques.

VISCOELASTICITY OF BIOFILMS AS A MEANS
OF SURVIVAL IN ANCIENT AND MODERN
ENVIRONMENTS

In their natural environment, most biofilms are exposed to ex-
ternal forces applied either in a compressive, tensile or shear
mode. Whereas microscopic techniques in general yield semi-
quantitative descriptions of structure and composition of a
biofilm at best, viscoelasticity is determined by an interplay of
structure and composition as outlined above, and can be quan-
titatively assessed over larger areas of a biofilm than microscop-
ically possible.

Biofilms are typical examples of a multi-component bio-
logical material. EPS alone is a multi-component substance
(Whitchurch et al., 2002; Flemming and Wingender 2010; Koo,
Falsetta and Klein 2013), and, as a consequence, biofilms react in
a time-dependent manner with a combination of distinct elas-
tic and viscous responses to external stress. The elastic part of
the response is immediate and followed by viscous relaxation
(Klapper et al., 2002; Stoodley et al., 2002) as represented by the
springs and dashpots in Fig. 1C, respectively. More specifically,
a number of studies suggest that biofilms behave as viscoelas-
tic liquids (Stoodley et al., 1999a; K ¨orstgens et al., 2001; Towler
et al., 2003; Shaw et al., 2004), i.e. they flow under sustained load,
and even though values of the elastic and viscous moduli vary
by many orders of magnitude, viscoelasticity is a common fea-
ture of many different types of medical, oral and environmental
biofilms (Shaw et al., 2004) (see also Table 1). Intriguingly, Shaw
et al. (2004) noticed that despite wide variations in elasticity and
viscosity of biofilms, their overall characteristic relaxation time
constant was about 18 min over a wide collection of biofilms
derived from fresh water and hot spring isolates, Staphylococcus
aureus, P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans strains. Consider-
ing that bacterial doubling times in regularly growing biofilms
are of the same order of magnitude (Gottenbos et al., 1999),
18 min may represent a possible survival significance as the
period over which a biofilm can respond to transient, external
stresses (Shaw et al., 2004).

There is evidence that the ability of biofilms to flow along
surfaces when exposed to elevated shear of an overlying water
stream may allow bacteria to yield to the flow, yet remain at-
tached to the surface. Time lapse images in flow cells captured
the flow and the ability of the biofilm to rapidly change ripple
and streamer morphology when the water flow was changed
(Stoodley et al., 1999b). Ripple structures have also been observed
in modern streams (Battin et al., 2003) as well as ancient fossils
(Noffke et al., 2013a; Noffke, Decho and Stoodley 2013b; Thomas
et al., 2013). Energy dissipation through such viscoelastic behav-
ior can also explain the large pressure drops and drag associated
with biofilms in systems as diverse as sulfate-reducing bacterial
biofilms in industrial pipelines (Dunsmore et al., 2002) as well as
biofouling of ship hulls (Schultz et al., 2011).

SURVIVAL OF INFECTIOUS BIOFILMS UNDER
MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL CHALLENGE

In addition to survival in natural environments, biofilm vis-
coelasticity, as a corollary of structure and composition, also has
implications for the way pathogenic biofilms deal with mechan-
ical and chemical challenges, particularly when biofilms are as-
sociated with biomaterials implants and devices, as will be illus-
trated in the following sections.

Survival of biofilms on intravascular catheters
in the human blood stream

Catheter-associated blood stream infections are common after
long-term catheterization of patients and result from catheter-
associated biofilms. Biofilms on intravascular catheters have to
withstand the fluctuating shear from the pulsatile blood flow,
using their viscoelastic properties to adjust to local changes in
fluid flows while maintaining their structural integrity. In an
initial attempt to withstand increasing shear forces, biofilms
extend in the direction of flow through re-arrangement into
so-called ‘streamers’, as shown in Fig. 4A (Rusconi et al., 2010,
2011). The viscoelasticity of biofilms allows these streamers
the possibility to extend and therewith organisms residing in
the biofilm gain time to adapt to the new flow conditions. Re-
cently, it was hypothesized that viscoelastic streamer formation
by S. aureus in intravenous catheter may block these catheters
(Kim et al., 2014). However, it is also possible that the formation
and breaking of viscoelastic EPS tethers allow S. aureus biofilms

to roll along catheter surfaces (Rupp, Fux and Stoodley 2005),
much like selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling during extravasa-
tion (Sundd, Pospieszalska and Ley 2013). Recent evidence has
suggested that biofilms might be involved in the formation of
atherosclerotic plaques and be involved in their detachment
(Lanter, Sauer and Davies 2014). How and when biofilms in the
blood stream fail is arguably the most important biofilm prop-
erty in an intravascular catheter application (Guelon, Mathias
and Stoodley 2011).

Biofilms on endotracheal tubes

Endotracheal tubes are used to intubate patients for breathing
and deliver pulsatile flow during a positive pressure inspired de-
livery and neutral pressure expired release. The gas is humidi-
fied and a moist layer containing respiratory secretions forms
on the inner lumen of the tube which rapidly becomes colonized
with bacteria from the oral cavity, upper airway and nosocomial
hospital pathogens (Vandecandelaere et al., 2013). Bacteria from
biofilms on endotracheal tubes can enter the airway to cause
ventilator-associated pneumonia through spreading growth, de-
tachment into the gas stream (Inglis et al., 1989). However, Inglis
(1993) also made the salient observation that endotracheal tube
biofilms had formed wave-like structures and hypothesized that
these might be caused by biofilm flow along the surface, con-
tributing to ventilator-associated pneumonia. As discussed pre-
viously, time lapse imaging has shown that biofilms can form
ripples and flow as viscoelastic liquids induced by the overlying
liquid flow (Stoodley et al., 1999b) with implications for dissem-
ination of pathogens within or from medical devices.

Mechanical removal of biofilms in the oral cavity

In the oral cavity as well as in the blood stream, biofilms are me-
chanically challenged by naturally occurring fluid flows, but also
by tongue movements and daily toothbrushing. Toothbrushing
removes oral biofilm through direct contact with toothbrush fil-
aments, but powered toothbrushes also do so in a non-contact
mode (Verkaik et al., 2010), provided the energy output of the
brush is high enough (Busscher et al., 2010). The energy out-
put of powered toothbrushes varies according to distance from
the edge of the toothbrush filaments and navigates the com-
plex geometry of tooth surfaces. Thus, removal of oral biofilms
via non-contact mode brushing is susceptible to a wide distri-
bution of shear forces (Rmaile et al., 2014). The viscoelasticity
of oral biofilms under non-contact brushing causes the biofilm
to expand rather than to directly disperse prior to disruption
(Busscher et al., 2010). Moreover, if toothbrushing is arrested be-
fore biofilm detachment occurs, biofilms are left in an expanded
state (see Fig. 4B) (He et al., 2014).

cal and chemical challenges. (A) Side view of a streamer in a biofilm grow-

Antimicrobial penetration in oral biofilms

Penetration of chlorhexidine into oral biofilms increased with in-
creasing relative importance of the slow and decreasing impor-
tance of the fast relaxation element (see Fig. 4C) (He et al., 2013).
Involvement of slow relaxation elements suggests that biofilm
structures allowing extensive bacterial re-arrangement after de-
formation are more open, allowing better antimicrobial pene-
tration. Involvement of fast relaxation elements suggests that
water dilutes the antimicrobial upon penetration to an ineffec-
tive concentration in deeper layers of the biofilm (He et al., 2013).
Note that these results could also have been expressed in one
principal component, since the more open structure allowing

bacterial re-arrangement inversely relates to the presence of
water-filled channels (Peterson et al., 2013). The flow of water
through biofilms is an important consideration in terms of an-
timicrobial penetration to target bacteria in a biofilm. Generally,
flow will be primarily from convection (fast) and diffusion (slow).
Early work with fluorescent microspheres and nano-injection of
fluorescent dyes established that an overlying flow induced con-
vective flow in the channels (Stoodley, De Beer and Lewandowski
1994), while in clusters alone there was only diffusion. Larger
molecules such as human IgG antibody could not penetrate the
EPS matrix (DeBeer, Stoodley and Lewandowski 1997). Neverthe-
less, submerged biofilms themselves are highly compressible
(Peterson et al., 2012), and since water is incompressible there
must be a dewatering effect to explain the biofilm volume de-
crease. Under compression, it is likely that water is squeezed
out of the channels, and, while it has not been directly shown
whether compression induces convection through the EPS ma-
trix of the cell clusters, modeling of the viscoelastic response
predicts that there is (He et al., 2013). Squeezing out of water
through channels in compressed biofilms may also constitute
the reason as to why biofilm elasticity and viscosity vary when
derived in different modes of stress application. In many exper-
imental systems, biofilms are usually ‘unconfined’ and stress is
applied locally over a relatively small surface area, allowing wa-
ter to flow away from the stressed region to its surrounding as
is also possible in natural conditions.

VISCOELASTICITY OF BIOFILMS: A POSSIBLE
TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF INFECTION

In the medical arena, the pathogenicity of bacteria is usually
related to conventional definitions of virulence describing vir-
ulence factors as molecules that are essential for a pathogen to
cause disease. Such factors include molecules that enable the
pathogen to colonize the host by attachment to and invasion
in host tissue, or to evade the host immune response. However,
with the growing realization that biofilms rather than plankton-
ically present organisms represent the more pathogenic state of
bacterial growth, additional factors come into play. In a biofilm,
bacterial adhesion to a substratum surface causes a phenotypic
change that makes removal upon a mechanical challenge more
difficult (Vuopio-Varkila and Schoolnik 1991; Gonzalez-Valencia,
Munoz and Torres 1991; Pal et al., 1992; Kallman et al., 1993).
Mechanical strategies used by biofilms to persist in the envi-
ronment which allow part to remain attached, coalesce and
flow over surfaces, while other parts detach in response to
external mechanical forces, are being seen as playing an im-
portant role for persistence of infection (Lieleg et al., 2011;
Stewart 2014). In addition, structure and composition of the EPS
matrix of oral biofilms as reflected in the viscoelastic proper-
ties of a biofilm, have been related with bacterial activity in
a biofilm (Koo, Falsetta and Klein 2013). The biofilm mode of
growth is also recognized to increase recalcitrance to antimicro-
bials as a result of diffusion limitation through the biofilm (Ar-
ciola, Campoccia and Montanaro 2002; Oelschlaeger, Dobrindt
and Hacker 2002). Survival requires structural and composi-
tional re-arrangements to evade these challenges on an appro-
priate timescale, as represented in the viscoelasticity of a biofilm
(Shaw et al., 2004).

The realization that viscoelasticity is a quantifiable reflec-
tion of the structure and composition impacting its survival
under mechanical or chemical challenge opens new pathways
for the control of biofilms in disease and understanding of

ill-understood phenomena like the increased susceptibility of
biofilms to antibiotics in combination with pulsating waves of
energy (Rediske et al., 1998). The CLSM images in Fig. 4B clearly
demonstrated that biofilms expand upon the transfer of energy
by non-contact, powered toothbrushing (Busscher et al., 2010;
He et al., 2014). This effect was accompanied by an increase
in the slow and a decrease in the fast Maxwell relaxation of
these biofilms. These changes facilitated increased penetra-
tion of oral antimicrobials (He et al., 2014). Non-contact, pow-
ered toothbrushing is usually done at frequencies between 260
and 750 Hz (Blanco et al., 1997). These frequencies might be
aligned in the future with the characteristic time constants
or resonance frequencies of the different relaxation processes
occurring upon mechanically challenging a biofilm, to increase
bacterial detachment. Obviously, the implications of this sug-
gestion reach beyond oral health care, and pertain to all situ-
ations where it is desirable or necessary to remove biofilms by
mechanical means.

Pulsating waves of energy have been shown to amplify an-
timicrobial efficacy against biofilms, and is generally referred to
as the ‘bio-acoustic effect’ (Pitt et al., 1994; Shen et al., 2010). Gen-
tamicin has been shown to have enhanced killing in P. aeruginosa
and Escherichia coli biofilms in vitro and in vivo in rabbits after ul-
trasound treatment with frequencies ranging from 30 to 500 kHz
and energies ranging from 10 to 3000 mW cm−2 (Qian, Stoodley
and Pitt 1996; Rediske et al., 2000; Carmen et al., 2004, 2005). Al-
though biofilms of Gram-positive bacteria were initially thought
to be resistant to enhanced killing from ultrasonic waves (Pitt
et al., 1994), with enough energy input (3000 mW cm−2) Gram-
positive bacteria were also found to be susceptible (Rediske
et al., 1998). Reducing the frequency of the wave to 2–3 Hz in-
creased efficacy of antimicrobials in biofilms of S. aureus and
single and mixed species oral biofilms (Gerdesmeyer et al., 2005;
Novak et al., 2008; Muller et al., 2011). Since, despite the lower fre-
quencies used in non-contact, powered toothbrushing (Blanco
et al., 1997), there is an analogy between non-contact powered
toothbrushing with the bio-acoustic effect, it is likely that ultra-
sound will change the structure of biofilms to cause better pen-
etration of antimicrobials into a biofilm and therewith increased
killing. Viscoelastic measurements have not yet been done how-
ever on ultrasonically treated biofilms, but such measurements
may shed more light on the mechanisms of the bio-acoustic
effect. Interestingly, low frequencies were more efficient in in-
creasing the killing efficacy of antimicrobials than higher ones
(Qian, Sagers and Pitt 1999). The characteristic time constants
derived from the stress relaxation of deformed biofilms, ranging
from <5 s, 5–100 s and >100 s for the fast, intermediate and slow
elements, respectively, suggest that the main effects of pulsating
energy waves are through effects on the fast principal Maxwell
element and thus associated with the presence of water in the
biofilm. At the low frequencies associated with more efficient
killing, the pulsating energy waves are closer to cutoff between
the frequencies of the fast and intermediate Maxwell elements.
Taken together, these considerations point to a new pathway to
increase the efficacy of pulsating waves of energy by fine-tuning
the frequencies of these treatments to the resonance frequen-
cies of the different constituents in biofilm matrices, which will
have a major impact on both their mechanical stability and an-
timicrobial penetration through a direct effect on the viscoelas-
ticity of biofilms.

Changes in viscoelastic properties of biofilms that enhance
antimicrobial efficacy can not only be achieved through pul-
sating waves of energy but also chemically (Jones et al., 2011).
After exposure to detergents, S. aureus biofilms grown on

reflecting bacterial

stainless steel had increased expression of the slowest Maxwell
re-arrangement. Pseudomonas
element,
aeruginosa biofilms on stainless steel were affected by N-acetyl-
L-cysteine, as both the fast and intermediate Maxwell elements
were reduced by more than 50%, while the slowest Maxwell
element nearly doubled. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on
membrane filters were similarly affected by both N-acetyl-L-
cysteine and DNaseI, reducing both the fastest and intermediate
principal elements (Peterson et al., 2013). Thus, both the pre-
treatment and post-treatment of biofilms by chemicals directly
affects their viscoelastic properties and changes them into a
direction favorable for subsequent antimicrobial treatment.

CONCLUSIONS

Bacterial biofilms provide added protection against environmen-
tal detachment forces, antimicrobials and the host immune
system, increasing the chance of survival under mechanical
and chemical attack. This review identifies the viscoelasticity
of biofilms as a corollary of the structure and composition of
biofilms. The viscoelasticity of biofilms therewith becomes a
quantifiable property of biofilms, pivotal for the way biofilms
deal with mechanical and chemical challenges. This identifica-
tion opens new pathways to prevent or control bacterial biofilms
by intervening with their viscoelastic properties that may be par-
ticularly relevant in the medical arena where over 60% of all hu-
man infections are due to biofilms.
