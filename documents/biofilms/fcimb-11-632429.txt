INTRODUCTION TO BIOFILMS - PROPERTIES OF BIOFILMS

The idea that most bacteria in nature are attached to surfaces was recognized as early as 1933 when
Henrici stated after investigating fresh-water bacteria that “it is quite evident that for the most part
water bacteria are not free ﬂoating organisms, but grow attached upon submerged surfaces”
(Henrici, 1933). Zobell followed up with work that demonstrated seawater bioﬁlms precede the
attachment of other macro-fouling organisms (Zobell and Allen, 1935). Thus, began this ﬁeld of
research which was furthered by work on bioﬁlms occurring in nature and the growing realization
that a number of infections are bioﬁlm-related (Costerton et al., 1999; Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004).

Bioﬁlm Life Cycle
Bioﬁlms are structurally diverse and dynamic (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004). Bioﬁlm formation occurs
in stages beginning with the attachment of a cell on the surface, followed by division and secretion of
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and formation of microcolonies (Costerton et al., 1987).
There are channels that allow for exchange of nutrients and cellular waste between the
microcolonies. The ﬁnal stage of the bioﬁlm lifecycle is dispersal which is driven by, but not
limited to environmental cues and bacterially derived signals (reviewed in (McDougald et al., 2011).
These signals include the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (Jenal et al., 2017), nitric oxide (Barraud
et al., 2009) and quorum sensing (Rice et al., 2005).

Increased Resistance to Antimicrobials and Matrix Properties
Bioﬁlms are more resistant to a variety of stresses than their planktonic counterparts. For example,
bioﬁlms have been reported to be up to 1000-fold more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic cells
(Costerton et al., 1999) as well as showing increased resistance to other environmental stresses and
predation by protists (Matz et al., 2005). This increased resistance is due to changes in cellular
metabolism of bioﬁlm cells compared to planktonic cells (Lebeaux et al., 2014; Crabbé et al., 2019).
It is also due to the physical protection provided by the extracellular matrix (Flemming and
Wingender, 2010).

The bioﬁlm matrix is composed of a variety of biopolymers, including polysaccharides, proteins,
nucleic acids, lipids, and other biopolymers such as humic substances (Flemming and Wingender,
2010). These components can vary widely between different bacterial species. The polysaccharides
and proteins help to protect bioﬁlm cells from antimicrobials by acting as a barrier to their
penetration into the bioﬁlm. Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires extracellular DNA or eDNA to form
a bioﬁlm and for motility within the bioﬁlm (Whitchurch et al., 2002; Gloag et al., 2013). It is this
matrix that lends stability to the bioﬁlm making them difﬁcult to remove. The matrix can also bind

CHALLENGES IN METHODS FOR
INVESTIGATING BIOFILMS

From Monospecies to
Polymicrobial Bioﬁlms
Since the early observation of bioﬁlms in their natural
environments, notably in rivers, researchers have realized the
heterogeneity and complexity of bioﬁlm composition and
structure. After a long period during which monospecies bioﬁlms
have been studied with success we have moved towards the study
of polymicrobial bioﬁlms, which are also relevant in multiple
bioﬁlm-associated infections in animals and humans and often at
the origin of chronic infections (Peters et al., 2012; Wolcott et al.,
2013). Among the multitude of in vitro and in vivo models of
bioﬁlm formation and infection models that have been developed
(Coenye and Nelis, 2010; Lebeaux et al., 2013; Brackman and
Coenye, 2016) some speciﬁc models are dedicated to polymicrobial
bioﬁlms (Gabrilska and Rumbaugh, 2015; Tay et al., 2016). The
relevance of studying polymicrobial bioﬁlms was demonstrated by
the importance of the interactions of micro-organisms for the
development of bioﬁlms in the context of infection, notably
through the cross-talk between species and their impact on
mechanisms of antimicrobial recalcitrance (Kragh et al., 2016;
Liu et al., 2016; Orazi and O’Toole, 2019; Ibberson and Whiteley,
2020). Further developments of such models are essential to
uncover the molecular mechanisms beyond the speciﬁc behavior
of micro-organisms during such polymicrobial bioﬁlms.

Tackling the Heterogeneity of Bioﬁlms
In addition to the complexity of polymicrobial bioﬁlms, one
hallmark of bioﬁlms in general is their heterogeneity in terms of
local environmental conditions that translates into a heterogeneity
of physiology of bioﬁlm cells. While studies using technologies
such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have been
successfully applied to image the global physiology or responses to
stress of bioﬁlms cells (Seneviratne et al., 2020), there is a clear
need to think singularity and to develop technologies that would
allow for the study of the physiology of individual bioﬁlm cells and
to understand the social interactions within bioﬁlms (Rode et al.,
2020). These studies can be performed with the improvement of
methods such as single-cell RNA transcriptomics (Blattman et al.,
2020; Imdahl et al., 2020) and technologies used to isolate cells
from bioﬁlms (Ma et al., 2019). Such recently developed
technologies have been successfully applied to image the
physiology of S. aureus persister cells within macrophages and
should be applied hopefully to bioﬁlms. Imaging technologies have
also recently improved to locate and trace individual cells within
bioﬁlms. Multiplex FISH technology has been applied to
characterize the biogeography of the oral microbiota (Valm
et al., 2012; Valm, 2019) while recent microscopy imaging and
analyzing technologies allowing for dynamically tracking single
bioﬁlm bacteria (Hartmann et al., 2019), for example upon
antibiotic stress in V. cholerae (Dı́az-Pascual et al., 2019).

Additionally, some very promising tools have been recently
adapted to metabolite identiﬁcation at the single cell level in
bioﬁlm,
for instance using Raman spectroscopy, Mass
spectrometry or electro-chemical chip/ﬂuorophores (Baig et al.,
2016; Bellin et al., 2016; Bodelón et al., 2016; Schiessl et al., 2019;
Geier et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). The upcoming challenge will
be, in addition to further development of these technologies, to
adapt them to direct observation or characterization of in situ
bioﬁlms and to models, whether in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo, that
better feature real in situ bioﬁlms.

Going Toward a Better Understanding of
In Vivo Bioﬁlms: Improving Detection and
Observation of In Situ Bioﬁlms and
Developing Novel Models?
Today there is absolutely no doubt that bioﬁlms occur in vivo,
especially in compromised hosts, with almost 80% of human
infections now recognized to be bioﬁlm-related (NIH, 2002).
Bioﬁlms form in body compartments as well as attached to cells
and indwelling devices (Bjarnsholt et al., 2013). One well-studied
example of this is the infection of cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) patients’ lungs
by P. aeruginosa. These bioﬁlms are extremely resistant to
antimicrobials for reasons discussed above but also due to their
ability to resist host defenses. For example, in both in vitro and in
vivo CF models, P. aeruginosa was shown to respond to the
presence of host immune cells by upregulating a number of
quorum-sensing regulated virulence factors such as rhamnolipids
which are known to kill immune cells (Alhede et al., 2009). Other
common chronic infections include chronic otitis media and
chronic wounds that tend to be caused by multispecies infections
(Burmølle et al., 2010). Other major sources of in vivo bioﬁlms are
indwelling medical devices such as intravenous or urinary catheters,
pacemakers, endotracheal tubes and artiﬁcial joints (Lebeaux et al.,
2014; Stewart and Bjarnsholt, 2020). Microorganisms commonly
associated with medical devices are Staphylococcus epidermidis,
Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa (Hall-Stoodley et al.,
2004). These bioﬁlms often result in replacement of the device,
which for artiﬁcial joints is a signiﬁcant task. The dispersal of these
bioﬁlms has been discussed as a potential treatment, however a
large number of planktonic cells entering the blood stream may be
more dangerous than other treatments. Numerous infections are
also related to bioﬁlms in animals, for example in bovine mastitis,
pneumonia, liver abscess, enteritis, urinary tract infection, otitis,
wound infection, etc. (Abdullahi et al., 2016) and in plants where
bacterial and fungal pathogens colonization can be at the origin of
different diseases (Bogino et al., 2013; Castiblanco and Sundin,
2016; Motaung et al., 2020).

For decades our vision of how bioﬁlms look has been governed
by our knowledge developed from the use of in vitro bioﬁlms
models. As stated above, the increasing number of bioﬁlms
isolated from real
infection situations have brought into
question this conventional thinking with the recognition that,
with some exception, in vivo bioﬁlms rather correspond to patches
or cell aggregates that rarely exceed 200 µm (Bjarnsholt et al.,
2013) with important consequences on how bioﬁlms ﬁnally
interact with the host (Alhede et al., 2020). These observations
have led to several important statements: in most cases, in vitro,

and sometimes in vivo bioﬁlms models do not relevantly
recapitulate bioﬁlms in their real
infectious context; the
diagnosis of the presence of bioﬁlms linked to infection cannot
be made a posteriori if we want clinicians to adapt their treatment
to the presence of a bioﬁlm. With these statements come potential
actions: on one side the necessity to improve detection methods
that could, for some of them, allow early detection of bioﬁlms in
the host and, for others, give a better characterization of the
environment of infectious bioﬁlms. Thus, the need to implement
some of the in situ information into the current in vitro and in vivo
models, and to develop novel models is paramount. It is clear that
to this day some effort has been made in these directions, but we
will have to do much more to reach these objectives.

We are still trying to identify bioﬁlm biomarkers that could be
used not only for detection but also for vaccine development.
Important work has been done in the laboratory of the late Prof.
Mark Shirliff in this direction notably with a recent demonstration
that S. aureus orthopedic implant infections could be detected in
human sinuvial ﬂuids using an antibody against the manganese
transporter MntC (Harro et al., 2019; Harro et al., 2020). Peptide-
ﬂuorescently labeled probes have been recently identiﬁed and used
to speciﬁcally label P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms in vivo (Locke et al.,
2020). Additionally, numerous other detection methods are under
development and efforts should be made to allow these
technologies to translate into the clinic (Achinas et al., 2020;
Parlak and Richter-Dahlfors, 2020). Among them, recently there
has been the successful use of imaging technologies using
bioluminescence (Chauhan et al., 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2019;
Maiden et al., 2019; Gordon et al., 2020; Kreth et al., 2020; Redman
et al., 2020; Van Dyck et al., 2020) or intravital
imaging
(Thanabalasuriar et al., 2019; Abdul Hamid et al., 2020; Gries
et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020) to study the effect of antimicrobial
agents on bioﬁlms or the behavior of immune cells in contact with
bioﬁlms in various in vivo models of bioﬁlm-related infections.

The concept of the micro-environment of bioﬁlm cells during
infection has been well conceptualized in a recent perspective
article on chronic wounds where several deﬁned zones can be
identiﬁed and on which information should be gathered in order to
access to a global view of the bioﬁlm infectious micro-environment
(Kirketerp-Møller et al., 2020). Ideally, non-destructive methods to
sample and analyze this micro-environment using micro-dialysis,
micro-probes or electrochemical probes should be adapted to in
vivo measurement as recently explained in (Røder et al., 2020),
however, some of these methods also have applications for
bioﬁlm detection.

Improving the models for a better understanding of bioﬁlm
formation and bioﬁlm cells behavior is also a major objective that
should be reached by researchers in the ﬁeld. Initiatives to evaluate
the available models are welcome and should provide a better view

of the current more relevant models with some clues on how to
improve them (Cornforth et al., 2020). With the increased
pressure to restrict the use of animals in research there is also a
dire need to identify surrogate models. While there is some utility
to pursue the development of non-mammalian models of bioﬁlm-
infection such as Drosophila melanogaster, Galleria mellonella or
Danio rerio (Zebraﬁsh) (Lebeaux et al., 2013), identiﬁcation of ex
vivo models that recreate the infectious environment should be
encouraged. Among recently developed ex vivo models are, for
example, an ex vivo pig lung bioﬁlm model used for understanding
antibiotic tolerance of P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms (Hassan et al., 2020)
or an ex vivo murine skin biopsy model to characterize B.
burgdoferi bioﬁlms, the etiological agent of Lyme disease (Torres
et al., 2020). Last but not least with the development of
reconstituted organs such as organoids or organ-on-a-chip, one
could anticipate that adaptations of these models to the
understanding of the physiopathology of bioﬁlm infections,
interactions of bioﬁlms with the immune response or bioﬁlm
behaviors in the presence of antimicrobials would provide
important information relevant to bioﬁlms in infectious contexts
(Jimi et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020).

Major Challenges
As described above, the ﬁeld of bioﬁlms and interactions with
higher organisms has clear challenges for future research. 1) The
development of new and improved multi-species bioﬁlm models
will allow us to investigate interactions that occur in these
bioﬁlms, as most in vivo bioﬁlms are multispecies bioﬁlms.
This is clearly the next step in understanding bioﬁlms in
nature and in disease contexts, and this should come with the
use of technologies that would allow probing the infectious
micro-environment of bioﬁlms. 2) The development of more
relevant models, whether in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo, to elucidate
interactions of bioﬁlms with the host in more detail. These
models will be necessary not only for understanding bioﬁlm
host interactions but also for the investigation of eradication
methods or compounds in a more real setting. 3) The
development of imaging and detection technologies that could
be used to better visualize and detect bioﬁlms in situ and should
allow when necessary to access the physiology on individual cells
within bioﬁlms. As new methods are developed, using these for
bioﬁlm research will generate new knowledge and lead to new
areas of bioﬁlm research.
