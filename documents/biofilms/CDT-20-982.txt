Abstract:  Background:  It  has  been  proposed  that  GAS  may  form  biofilms.  Biofilms  are  microbial 
communities that aggregate on a  surface, and exist within  a self-produced matrix of  extracellular po-
lymeric substances. Biofilms offer bacteria an increased survival advantage, in which bacteria persist, 
and  resist  host  immunity  and  antimicrobial  treatment.  The  biofilm  phenotype  has  long  been  recog-
nized  as  a  virulence  mechanism  for  many  Gram-positive  and  Gram-negative  bacteria,  however  very 
little is known about the role of biofilms in GAS pathogenesis.  

Objective: This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of biofilms in GAS pathogene-
sis. This review assesses the evidence of GAS biofilm formation, the role of GAS virulence factors in 
GAS biofilm formation, modelling GAS biofilms,  and discusses the polymicrobial nature of biofilms 
in the oropharynx in relation to GAS. 

Conclusion:  Further  study  is  needed  to  improve  the  current  understanding  of  GAS  as  both  a  mono-
species  biofilm,  and  as  a  member  of  a  polymicrobial  biofilm.  Improved  modelling  of  GAS  biofilm 
formation  in  settings  closely  mimicking  in  vivo  conditions  will  ensure  that  biofilms  generated  in  the 
lab closely reflect those occurring during clinical infection. 

Keywords: Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A Streptococcus, biofilms, biofilm formation, antibiotics, virulence factors, biofilm

1. INTRODUCTION 

  Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a Gram-positive patho-
gen,  with  the  human  population  serving  as  its  only  known 
reservoir. GAS is known to cause an array of diseases rang-
ing from mild, superficial infections such as impetigo, tonsil-
litis and pharyngitis, to serious invasive infections including 
necrotizing  fasciitis,  Streptococcal  toxic  shock  syndrome, 
cellulitis,  and  autoimmune  sequelae  (including  rheumatic 
heart disease, acute rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis) 
[1, 2]. Globally, GAS  causes 700 million  infections and ac-
counts for half a million deaths per year [3]. 

Increased  use  of  macrolides  for  the  treatment  of  GAS 
infections has seen an increase in resistance; however, there 
have been no reports of resistance to penicillin among clini-
cal GAS isolates [4-6]. Despite GAS remaining sensitive  to 
penicillin,  a  number  of  studies  have  indicated  antibiotic 
treatment failure rates of 20-40% [5, 7]. Numerous hypothe-
ses  explaining  antibiotic  treatment  failure  have  been  pro-
posed,  including  biofilm  formation  [4,  5,  8].  The  biofilm 
increased  survival  advantage,  
phenotype  provides  an

enabling bacteria  to persist  and resist both host  immune de-
fenses  and  antimicrobial  treatment  [4,  9,  10].  Although  the 
biofilm  phenotype  has  been  studied  extensively  for  other 
bacteria,  little  is  known  about  GAS  biofilm  in  vitro  or  in 
vivo.  This  review  provides  an  overview  of  the  current 
knowledge of the GAS biofilm. 

2. BIOFILMS IN GAS PATHOGENESIS 

  Biofilm  formation  is  recognized  as  a  virulence  mecha-
nism for a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac-
terial  species  [11-14].  The  presence  of  GAS  biofilms  in  a 
variety  of  clinical  infections  suggests  this  phenotype  may 
play a role in GAS pathogenesis [15, 16]. While there have 
been  numerous  studies  that  have  characterized  the  role  of 
GAS  virulence  factors  in  biofilm  formation,  studies  assess-
ing the role of biofilm formation in GAS pathogenesis have 
been  limited.  To  understand  GAS  as  a  biofilm,  it  is  first 
important to understand the biofilm phenotype.  

2.1. Bacterial Biofilms 

  Bacteria  can  exist  either  in  planktonic  or  biofilm  states. 
Planktonic  cells  are  singular  ‘free  floating’  entities  existing 
in  a  liquid  environment  [17],  whereas  in  biofilms,  bacteria 
exist as sessile aggregates encased in a self-produced matrix 
of  Extracellular  Polymeric  Substances  (EPS)  attached  to  a 
biological or non-biological surface [18].  Biofilm  cells vary

drastically in their physiology, growth rate, and gene expres-
sion when compared to planktonic cells. Furthermore, it has 
become  clear  that  bacteria  frequently  flux  between  plank-
tonic  and  biofilm  states,  which  is  central  to  biofilm  forma-
tion and development [19, 20].  

2.1.1. Biofilm Formation and Development 

  Biofilm  formation  is  a  dynamic,  multifaceted  process 
triggered by environmental cues that prompt changes in gene 
expression.  This  results  in  a  re-organization  of  the  spatial 
and temporal arrangement of bacterial cells leading to a tran-
sition  from  the  planktonic  phenotype,  to  a  biofilm  [21]. 
Overall,  biofilm  formation  and  development  has  been  well-
defined, and can be simplified into 4 steps: i) reversible bac-
terial  attachment;  ii)  irreversible  bacterial  attachment;  iii) 
biofilm  maturation  and  iv)  biofilm  dispersal  [21].  In  brief, 
initial reversible attachment of free-floating planktonic  cells 
to a host tissue surface is driven by environmental cues (e.g. 
pH,  temperature,  ions,  nutrients,  and  gas/O2  availability), 
forces of gravity, Brownian motion, and local environmental 
hydrodynamics  [21-23].  Some  motile  bacteria  may  use  ap-
pendages (e.g. pili and flagella) for migration [24, 25]. Upon 
irreversible  attachment,  EPS,  consisting  of  polysaccharides, 
proteins,  nucleic  acids,  and  lipids  are  produced  and  this 
meshwork  provides  the  scaffold  for  a  complex,  three-
dimensional biofilm architecture [11, 26]. At  this stage,  ini-
tial  micro-colonies  begin  to  form  [27].  Biofilm  maturation 
can be induced by quorum sensing signals prompting pheno-
typic  changes  and  genetic  diversification.  This  process  re-
sults  in  enhanced  structural  defense  against  biological, 
physical, and chemical stress, which assists nutrient acquisi-
tion by forming complex water/nutrient channels, and facili-
tates  reproductive  ability  [28].  Dispersal  of  bacterial  cells 
into  the  host  environment  is  the  final  stage  of  the  biofilm 
cycle  which  can  occur  passively  through  physical  forces 
such as fluid shear or abrasion, or can be induced in response 
to various environmental conditions (e.g. pH, nutrient levels, 
and gas concentrations), highly regulated signal transduction 
pathways, and effectors. Dispersal is key for re-colonization 
and re-establishment of the biofilm at other sites [19, 29]. 

2.1.2. Biofilm Resistance to Immune Clearance and Antim-
icrobial Agents 

It has been suggested that 99% of the world’s bacteria ex-
ist  in  a  biofilm  state,  highlighting  an  adaptive  advantage  of 
this phenotype  [30].  Biofilms  are highly  resistant  to both  an-
timicrobial  treatment  and  immune  action  [31].  Biofilm  com-
munities  are  ~10-1000  fold  more  resistant  to  antimicrobials 
when compared to their planktonic bacterial cell counterparts 
[32,  33].  Resistance  displayed  by  biofilm  communities  is  at-
tributed to, but not limited to: i) changes in gene expression; 
ii)  sharing of resistance  genes  via  horizontal gene  transfer or 
adaptive  mutations;  iii)  active  release  of  antibiotic-degrading 
enzymes; iv) three-dimensional structure; v) the physical EPS 
barrier  (to  both  antibiotics/antimicrobials  and  immune  cells) 
and vi) reduced metabolic activity among some bacterial cells 
found deep within the biofilm [34-36].  

2.2. Evidence of GAS Biofilm Formation 

  GAS typically infects the skin and mucosal surface of the 
oropharynx.  The  earliest  evidence  for  the  presence  of  GAS 

biofilm in vivo was found in impetigo lesions, where glyco-
calyx  encapsulated  micro-colonies  resembling    early  stage 
biofilm  formation  were  detected  via  FITC-ConA  staining 
and  visualized  by  confocal  laser  scanning  microscopy 
(CLSM) [37]. A more recent clinical case study described a 
previously  healthy  male  presenting  with  a  Necrotizing  Soft 
Tissue  Infection  (NSTI)  persisting  over  24  days.  The  sur-
geon noted  the  presence of  “thick  layer biofilm” in the pa-
tient’s  fascia  [16].  This  observation  prompted  the  team  to 
further investigate the biofilm as a constituent of GAS NSTI. 
A multicenter study revealed that 32% of patient tissue biop-
sies  (n=31)  contained  GAS  biofilm.  The  biofilms  found  in 
these  NSTIs  exacerbated  inflammation  and  led  to  severe 
tissue  damage  at  the  site  of  the  NSTI  infection;  moreover, 
the presence of bacterial loads far exceeded those of wound 
biopsies lacking biofilm. Taken together, these studies high-
light  the need for further consideration of GAS biofilm as a 
complicating factor in NSTIs.  

  GAS  enters  the  throat  via  the  oral  cavity  and  typically 
colonizes the oro-nasopharynx. Asymptomatic and persistent 
oropharyngeal  GAS  carriage  has  been  attributed  to  biofilm 
formation,  complicating,  and  contributing  to  oropharyngeal 
disease [38]. Although penicillin resistant GAS has not been 
reported, it has been hypothesized that GAS biofilm may be 
a contributing factor to the antibiotic treatment failure rate of 
20-40% associated with GAS infection [7, 39]. A number of 
clinically relevant GAS serotypes (M2, M6, M14, and M18) 
have  been  found  to  form  biofilm  in  vitro  on  both  uncoated 
surfaces, and surfaces coated with human fibronectin, human 
fibrinogen,  human  collagen  types  I  and  IV,  and  human 
laminin [39]. In a study observing GAS pharyngitis and anti-
biotic  treatment  failure,  all  99  GAS  isolates  collected  from 
patients  suffering  from  GAS  pharyngitis  displayed  biofilm 
forming  abilities  to  varying  degrees  [5].  The  Minimum 
Biofilm  Eradication  Concentrations  (MBECs)  were  overall 
higher  than  the  Minimum  Inhibitory  Concentration  (MIC) 
values  for  all  GAS  isolates,  with  resistance  to  penicillin 
demonstrated  by  60%  of  the  GAS  isolates  when  in  the 
biofilm phenotype. This study is one of the  earliest to dem-
onstrate  a link between  in vitro GAS biofilm formation and 
penicillin  insensitivity,  highlighting  the  protective  advan-
tages  offered  by  the  biofilm  phenotype  against  antibiotics 
like penicillin [5].  

  Another  study  investigated  289  differing  clinical  GAS 
isolates  from  carriers,  pharyngitis  cases,  and  invasive/non-
invasive  infections  in  an  attempt  to  understand  the  link  be-
tween clinical source, biofilm-forming ability, and antibiotic 
insensitivity  [4].  Although  90%  were  found  to  be  biofilm 
forming  in  vitro,  some  emm  types  displayed  a  greater  pro-
pensity for biofilm formation than others, this was especially 
apparent among emm 6 strains when assessed for the biofilm 
biomass.  However,  intra-strain  variability  within  an  M-type 
suggested  that  the  biofilm  formation  was  strain  specific 
rather  than  an overall characteristic offered by  the serotype. 
Moreover,  this  study  found  that  GAS  strains  which  were 
otherwise macrolide sensitive utilized the biofilm phenotype 
to  resist  β-lactam  treatment  [4].  A  more  recent  study  ex-
plored  biofilm  formation  by  15  differing  GAS  emm  types 
frequently  isolated  from  patients  suffering  from  recurrent 
GAS  pharyngitis  [8].  Findings  indicated  that  emm  types  1, 
12 and 28 were most abundant; however,  the  emm 6 strains

Vyas et al. 

produced  significantly  more  biofilm.  These  GAS  biofilms 
were 10 times more resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and 
clindamycin used individually or in combination when com-
pared  to  MICs  generated  for  their  planktonic  cell  counter-
parts. 

  An  in  vivo  study  by  Roberts,  et  al.  [15]  revealed  GAS 
residing  within  the  tonsillar  crypts  of  sufferers  of  recurrent 
GAS  tonsillopharyngitis  using  fluorescence  microscopy  and 
Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  (SEM).  The  group  also  ob-
served  cocci  chains  typical  of  GAS  arranged  in  three-
dimensional communities resemblant of biofilm in an ex vivo 
pig epithelium model [15].  

  Overall, it is apparent that both the skin and the throat are 
able to cultivate GAS biofilms from the earlier stages of mi-
cro-colony formation, to the more mature biofilm communi-
ties. Moreover, these findings highlight the clinical relevance 
of  GAS  biofilms  and  their  potential  role  in  antibiotic  treat-
ment  failure  in  recurrent  GAS  infections.  Taken  together, 
this  reinforces  the  need  for  further  investigation  into  GAS 
biofilm formation in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. 

2.2.1.  Virulence  Factors  Involved  in  GAS  Biofilm  Forma-
tion 

  GAS  expresses  multiple virulence factors  involved  in  ad-
herence to host tissue surfaces. GAS virulence factor expres-
sion is variable between individual strains, and differs between 
GAS  serotypes,  with  expression  and  regulation  impacted  by 
both  host  and  environmental  stimuli  [2,  40].  Several  GAS 
virulence  factors  have  been  implicated  in  various  stages  of 
biofilm phenotype development (Table 1 and Fig. 1).  

2.2.1.1. M Protein Family and Lipoteichoic Acid 

  The M protein is highly expressed on the surface of GAS, 
and  numerous  studies  have  demonstrated  a  role  for  M  pro-
tein  in  adherence,  as  it  facilitates  the  attachment  of  GAS  to 
host  epithelial  cells  [41-43].  It  has  also  been  proposed  that 
the M protein mediates initial cell-surface interactions during 
biofilm  formation.  Cho  and  Caparon  [44] demonstrated  this 
using an isogenic M protein deficient GAS HSC5 (emm 14) 
mutant  grown  on  abiotic  polystyrene  surfaces  under  static 
conditions.  The mutant displayed a decrease in biofilm bio-
mass relative to wild-type by safranin staining. Courtney, et 
al. [45] also observed significantly reduced biofilm biomass 
relative to wild-type for isogenic M protein mutants of emm 
1,  5,  6  and  24  isolates  under  similar  growth  conditions.  A 
correlation  has  been  shown  between  M  protein  expression 
and  the  levels  of  membrane-bound  lipoteichoic  acid  (LTA), 
surface hydrophobicity, and ability to form biofilms for emm 
types 1, 5, 6 and 24. Isogenic M protein deficient GAS mu-
tants  displayed  diminished  bacterial  hydrophobicity,  de-
creased  membrane-bound  LTA,  and  decreased  biofilm  bio-
mass relative to wild-type strains. It was suggested that com-
plex  interactions  between  M  protein  and  LTA  expose  the 
ester fatty acids of LTA, increasing bacterial hydrophobicity, 
ultimately  favoring  LTA-host  cell  interactions  [45].  Con-
versely,  no  significant  reduction  in  biofilm  biomass,  hydro-
phobicity  or  membrane-bound  LTA  was  observed  for 
isogenic M2, M4 and M49 protein deficient GAS. Notably, a 
key  difference  between  the  strains  displaying  M-protein-
LTA mediated adherence and those that did not, is their emm 
pattern classification. Specifically, emm1, 5, 6, and 24 strains 

all belong to the emm pattern A classification, which display 
a single M protein family member on their surface whilst the 
emm 2, 4 and 49 belong to the pattern D and E classification, 
which express other surface proteins of the M protein family, 
such as the M-related protein (mrp) and M-like protein (enn) 
on  their  surface.  Thus,  it  appears  that  the  M-protein-LTA 
interaction may be specific to strains expressing only one M 
protein  family  member.  Courtney,  et  al.  [45]  also  investi-
gated if the Mrp and Enn proteins participated in LTA com-
plex mediated biofilm formation and found a significant de-
crease 
in  hydrophobicity,  membrane-bound  LTA,  and 
biofilm  formation  relative  to  wild-type  using  an  isogenic 
mrp4  deficient  GAS  mutant  of  the  emm4  expressing  strain. 
However,  an  isogenic  enn4  deficient  GAS  mutant  was  also 
examined  and  there  was  no  difference  in  hydrophobicity, 
membrane-bound  LTA,  or  biofilm  formation  compared  to 
the  wild  type.  The  M  protein  has  previously  been  shown  to 
be expressed at significantly higher levels than Mrp and Enn 
in a CS101 GAS (emm49) strain [46]. Expression levels may 
play a part in the role of these proteins in LTA complex ini-
tiation  and  biofilm  formation;  however  this  has  yet  to  be 
determined. Collectively, this research highlights the need to 
study GAS biofilm formation using strains from diverse ge-
netic backgrounds. 

2.2.1.2. Pili 

Pili are long filamentous structures that  exist on the sur-
face of GAS, and numerous other bacterial species [58, 59]. 
Pili  are  encoded  by  the  FCT  (fibronectin-binding  protein, 
collagen-binding  protein,  and  trypsin-resistant  antigen)  ge-
nomic region of GAS. This is a highly variable 11kb patho-
genicity  island  which  contains  genes  for  a  pilus  backbone 
protein, at least one matrix protein binding ancillary protein, 
sortases  (SrtB/SrtC2),  and  a  signal  peptidase  [1,  40,  60]. 
GAS can be  classified into nine FCT subtypes based on the 
diversity  of  gene  content  and  nucleotide  sequence  [47,  61, 
62].  Pili  are  considered  a  major  adhesin  of  GAS,  as  their 
involvement  in  the  adherence  of  GAS  to  human  tonsillar 
tissue, keratinocytes,  lung, and  throat  epithelial cells  is well 
characterized  [63-65].  Numerous  studies  have  demonstrated 
that pili play an  integral part  in GAS biofilm formation and 
have  shown  associations  between  several  different  FCT 
types and  the capacity of GAS to form bacterial biofilms  in 
vitro [1, 8, 47, 58, 60].  

  Manetti,  et  al.  [1]  confirmed  that  GAS  FCT-2  pili  are 
essential  for  efficient  attachment  of  the  GAS  M1  strain 
SF370 to human epithelial cells, as GAS pilus negative mu-
tants,  constructed  by  either  deletion  of  the  pilus  backbone 
structural  protein  (Δspy0128)  or  the  sortase  C1  (Δspy0129) 
gene  which  are  essential  for  pili  assembly,  were  unable  to 
attach  to  epithelial  cells.  The  same  mutants  did  not  effi-
ciently aggregate in liquid culture and did not form sufficient 
biofilms  relative  to  the  wildtype  strain  on  polystyrene  as 
determined  by  crystal  violet  biomass  staining,  or  epithelial 
cells  as  observed  by  confocal  microscopy  [1].  Visualization 
of  the  wildtype,  Δspy0128  and  Δspy0129  strains  demon-
strated that the EPS was virtually absent for the mutant strains. 
This dramatically contrasted to the wild-type GAS SF370 strain 
and the complementation  mutant for which  the biofilm pheno-
type was restored. Together, these results demonstrate that FCT-
the  biofilm

GAS to abiotic/biotic  surfaces. This includes Streptococcal  collagen-like protein (Scl-1), pili, Group A Streptococcus protein A (AspA),  as

ence [1, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 52, 54]. Communication between bacteria may utilize quorum sensing (QS) systems, secreting QS molecules such 
as  Streptococcal  invasion  locus  protein  (SilC),  Short  Hydrophobic  Peptides  (SHP)  and  Autoinducer-2  (Al-2)  of  the  Streptococcal  invasion 
locus (Sil), Regulatory gene of glucosyltransferase (Rgg), and LuxS/autoinducer-2 QS systems, respectively to facilitate adherence and matu-
ration  of  biofilms  which  includes  the  production  of  the  extracellular  polymeric  matrix  (EPS)  [39,  55-57].  Studies  have  also  demonstrated 
strains that are encapsulated by hyaluronic acid do not form biofilm as readily as un-encapsulated strains, and it has been suggested that the 
hyaluronic acid capsule decreases biofilm forming capacity [9, 44, 51]. Decreased transcription of the Streptococcal regulator of virulence has 
also been shown to increase production of SpeB, a cysteine protease which may play a role in biofilm dispersal [53]. 

phenotype for this strain. Following these findings, Köller, et 
al. [60] assayed biofilm formation under an array of different 
growth conditions for 183 isolates that were  emm and FCT-
typed in an effort to demonstrate novel correlations between 
FCT-type  and  biofilm  formation.  Whilst  novel  associations 
between FCT-type and biofilm formation were demonstrated 
for  multiple  isolates,  the  study  did  not  support  a  direct  link 
between biofilm formation and FCT-type. This is most likely 
because  there  are  many  other  virulence  factors  that  play  a 
role in biofilm formation by GAS [60]. 

  There  is  also  data  to  suggest  that  the  role  of  individual 
FCT  types  in  biofilm  formation  may  be  dependent  on  envi-
ronmental  conditions during infection. In  a study of clinical 
isolates  obtained  from  the  University  Hospital  in  Rostock, 
Germany,  between  2001  and  2006,  an  association  was  ob-
served  between  environmental  conditions  (acidity)  and 
biofilm formation for different FCT-types [66]. Biofilm for-
mation  on  abiotic  surfaces  and  micro-colony  formation  on 
epithelial  cells for FCT-types 2, 3, 5 and 6, and a  subset of 
FCT-4 strains increased as a result of acidification caused by 
fermentative  sugar  metabolism.  The  subsequent  decrease  in 

environmental  pH  was  associated  with  an  enhanced  expres-
sion  of  the  pilus  components  and  transcriptional  regulators 
including  the  RofA-Like  Protein  (RALP)  regulator  family 
proteins  RofA  and  Nra,  and  the  AraC/XylS  type  transcrip-
tional  regulator  family  protein,  MsmR.  Manetti,  et  al.  [66] 
speculated  that  a  decreased  pH  at  the  cell  surface  due  to 
sugar metabolism may favor biofilm formation during colo-
nization;  however,  this  requires  further  investigation,  par-
ticularly to determine if pH plays a role in biofilm formation 
in the oropharynx [66]. 

  As  an  extension  of  the  study  by  Köller,  et  al.  [60]  that 
demonstrated  that  emm  type  6  strains  with  the  FCT-1  type 
pili form high levels of biofilm in vitro, Kimura, et al. [47] 
characterized  the  role  of  FCT-1  pili  in  the  GAS  strain 
TW3558  (emm6).  In-frame  deletions  of  the  pilus  backbone 
(tee6),  ancillary  protein  (fctX),  and  sortases  (srtB  and  srtA) 
were  used  to  produce  isogenic  pili  deficient  GAS  mutants. 
Use  of  the  mutants  in  biofilm  growth  assays  demonstrated 
that deletion of the tee6 gene compromised the ability of the 
strain to form a biofilm on an  abiotic surface, with deletion 
of  fctX  and  srtB  genes  (pilus  ancillary  protein  and  class  C

pilus-associated  sortase,  respectively)  further  decreasing  the 
capacity for biofilm formation. It was also noted that assem-
bly of the pili, rather than individual pili  components, is re-
quired  for  biofilm  formation.  The  FCT-1  pilus  region  (fctX 
operon) was then ectopically expressed in M1 strain SF370, 
and an increase in biofilm formation was observed, substan-
tiating the role of FCT-1 pili in biofilm formation. A similar 
study  was  conducted  by  Becherelli,  et  al.  [48],  whereby 
isogenic  mutants  of  ancillary  protein  1  (ALP-1)  of  FCT-1 
type  GAS  were  examined  for  biofilm  formation.  Wild-type 
bacteria  produced  substantial  biofilms,  whilst  the  mutant 
strain  exhibited  impaired  biofilm  forming  capacity  [48]. 
Taken  together,  the  data  from  Becherelli,  et  al.  [48]  and 
Kimura,  et  al.  [47]  suggests  both  structural,  and  assembly 
components  of  pili  are  important  in  adherence  and  biofilm 
formation  of  FCT-1  type  GAS.  However,  the  authors  high-
light  that  the  role  of  pili  should  not  be  considered  in  isola-
tion, as GAS biofilm formation is likely to be dependent on 
multiple factors [47].  

2.2.1.3. Streptococcal Collagen-like Protein 

Streptococcal collagen-like protein-1 (Scl-1) is expressed 
on the surface of GAS as a homotrimeric protein consisting 
of  a  N-terminal  variable  region,  a  collagen-like  region  con-
taining  Gly-X-Y  repeats,  and  a  cell-wall-anchored  C-
terminal  region  which  contains  a  linker  region  connecting 
the collagen-like region to the cell wall and membrane asso-
ciated  portions  of  the  protein  [54,  67,  68].  Transcription  of 
Scl-1  is  positively  regulated  by  the  multiple  gene  activator 
regulon, suggesting it may be co-expressed with many other 
GAS  virulence  factors  such  as  the  M  protein  family  [49]. 
Scl-1 is thought to be expressed by all strains of GAS and is 
regarded  as  a  major  cell  surface  adhesin  [67,  68].  It  is  also 
recognized  as  a  contributor  to  the  biofilm  forming  capacity 
of GAS on abiotic surfaces. Isogenic scl1 mutants have been 
shown to have a significantly reduced capacity for adhesion 
and  biofilm  development,  as  well  as  variation  in  surface 
morphology and EPS production [49]. In  this study,  the ex-
pression  of  the  Scl-1  protein  in  a  heterologous  Lactococcus 
lactis  system  facilitated  biofilm  formation,  further  implicat-
ing this protein in biofilm production. A study by Bachert, et 
al.  [50]  assaying  biofilm  formation  in  M3  GAS,  supported 
these  earlier  findings.  They  identified  47  M3  GAS  strains 
containing a nonsense mutation in the 11th Gly-X-Y repeat of 
the  collagenous  region.  Biofilms  of 
the  M3  strains 
(MGAS315  and  MGAS10870)  grown  on  abiotic  surfaces 
coated with fibronectin and laminin exhibited a significantly 
reduced  capacity  to  form  biofilm.  Moreover,  the  M3  GAS 
mutant was not able to form micro-colonies when introduced 
into  a  skin  infection  model.  When  the  nonsense  mutation 
was 
(MGAS315  and 
MGAS10870) through homologous complementation, resto-
ration  of  expression  increased  biofilm  formation  upon  fi-
bronectin  and  laminin  coated  surfaces  [50].  The  nonsense 
mutation  within  the  11th  Gly-X-Y  repeat  of  the  collagenous 
region had previously been shown to be present in 98.7% of 
479  sequenced  invasive  M3  isolates  [69].  Another  study  by 
Lukomski,  et  al.  [67]  also  demonstrated  this  polymorphism 
in  five  M3  strains,  but  not  in  any  of  the  other  20  M-types 
tested. Bachert,  et al. [50] therefore suggested this mutation 
is highly conserved and unique to M3 isolates and that Scl-1 
promotes stable biofilm formation for M3 GAS.

2.2.1.4. Hyaluronic Acid Capsule 

  The  Hyaluronic  Acid  (HA)  capsule,  a  major  virulence 
factor of GAS, is highly conserved and surface-exposed, and 
made from a polymer of repeating units of glucuronic and N-
acetylglucosamine [70]. Some studies suggest that HA is an 
adhesin  that  aids  in  the  attachment  of  GAS  strains  to  host 
cells [71, 72]. Conversely, it has been reported that HA cap-
sule can decrease Streptococcal adherence by preventing the 
surface-exposed  adhesins  from  attaching  to  host  cell  recep-
tors  [73].  The  capsule  is  also  central  to  immune  evasion 
upon  colonization  of  host  tissues,  and  generally,  encapsu-
lated  strains  display  a  greater  propensity  for  virulence  than 
those with a reduced/absent capsule [74]. Investigations into 
the  role  of  capsule  in  GAS  biofilm  formation  have  impli-
cated  HA  in  biofilm  maturation.  When  Cho  and  Caparon 
[44]  assessed  the  biofilm  forming  capacity  of  a  wild-type 
HSC5  GAS  strain  and  an  isogenic  capsule  deficient  mutant 
whereby  the  Hyaluronate  synthase  (HasA)  gene  was  abol-
ished,  they found biofilm forming ability of  the  mutant was 
not  affected  under  static  conditions.  This  suggests  HA  does 
not affect the  initial bacterial attachment that  is required for 
subsequent biofilm formation. To illustrate the role of HA in 
later stages of biofilm maturation, flow  chambers were util-
ized, and although the mutant was able to adhere to the sur-
face  of  the  chamber  it  was  unable  to  propagate  the  biofilm 
phenotype,  and  cells  seemed  to  appear  dispersed  across  the 
substratum evenly, suggesting that HA has a role in biofilm 
maturation [44]. A more recent study observed a decrease in 
HasA transcription in biofilms of MGAS315 (emm3) grown 
on  live  keratinocytes  (SCC13)  in  comparison  to  planktonic 
bacteria. Marks, et al. [9] suggested other factors must affect 
the  role  of  HA  in  biofilm  formation.  Indirect  evidence  that 
the  amount  of  capsule  inhibits  GAS  biofilm  formation  was 
reported  by  Sugareva,  et  al.  [51].  CovS  is  a  sensor  kinase 
involved in regulation of hyaluronic acid synthesis. Deletion 
of  covS  was  shown  to  lead  to  increased  capsule  production 
but lower biofilm biomass for emm2, 6, 18, and 49 [9]. Fur-
thermore,  Sugareva,  et  al.  [51]  suggested  strains  with  less 
HA formed biofilm  more readily. It could therefore be sug-
gested that the reduction in capsule production upon change 
from planktonic to biofilm phenotypes may facilitate biofilm 
maturation. Overall, the role of HA  in GAS biofilm has yet 
to be fully elucidated. 

2.2.1.5. Regulators of Gene Expression 

  Most oral streptococci  express Streptococcal antigen I/II 
(Agl  I/II)  family  polypeptides,  which  have  demonstrated 
roles in adhesion to human salivary glycoproteins, other mi-
crobial cells, and calcium to facilitate colonization in the oral 
cavity  [52,  75].  An  Agl  I/II  polypeptide  produced  by  M28 
GAS  called  Group  A  Streptococcus  protein  A  (AspA)  has 
been shown to have a role in biofilm formation in two inde-
pendently isolated M28 serotypes [52]. Deletion of the aspA 
gene in these  strains  abolished  their  ability to propagate the 
biofilm  phenotype  on  saliva-coated  surfaces.  The  biofilm 
developing  capacity  of  the  strain  was  reinstated  upon  trans-
complementation of the aspA deletion. Additionally, expres-
sion of the AspA protein in L. lactis allowed for biofilm de-
velopment  in  this  species,  relative  to  wild-type  L.  lactis. 
Whilst AspA is a relatively understudied GAS virulence fac-
tor, these results indicate AspA plays a role in adhesion and 
biofilm propagation in GAS.

Vyas et al. 

  The  Streptococcal  regulator  of  virulence  (Srv)  is  a  tran-
scriptional  regulator  required  for  GAS  virulence,  as  it  con-
trols the transcription of many extracellular proteins [53, 76]. 
There  is  also  some  evidence  indicating  participation  of  this 
virulence  factor  in  biofilm  formation.  An  isogenic  srv  defi-
cient  GAS  strain  (MGAS5005)  and  its  complementation 
mutant  were  used  to  demonstrate  that  Srv-mediated  tran-
scription  is  an  important  contributor  to  biofilm  formation 
[77]. A decreased capacity to form biofilm was observed for 
the srv deficient  strain which was restored to  levels compa-
rable  to  the  wild-type  strain  following  complementation.  It 
was  suggested  that  Srv  may  control  the  transcription  of 
genes  necessary  for  adherence  and  micro-colony  formation. 
One  of  the  extracellular  proteases  controlled  by  Srv  is  the 
cysteine  protease  SpeB  [77].  In  the  absence  of  srv,  over-
production  of  SpeB  is  associated  with  decreased  biofilm 
formation  [77].  Complementation  decreased  SpeB  produc-
tion and restored biofilm formation comparably to the wild-
type.  A  subcutaneous  model  of  skin  infection  in  mice  that 
were infected with the srv deficient strain (MGAS5005) sup-
ported previous findings as it demonstrated increased detec-
tion  of  SpeB,  decreased  detection  of  biofilm,  and  overall 
increased virulence relative to wild-type GAS. Furthermore, 
the model demonstrated that inactivation of SpeB in  the srv 
deficient strain was subsequently shown to reduce GAS viru-
lence  relative  to  wild-type  and  promote  biofilm  formation 
[75].  Doern,  et  al.  [76]  and  Connolly,  et  al.  [75]  both  pro-
posed  a  model  for  the  Srv-mediated  biofilm  dispersal,  sug-
gesting  SpeB  may  degrade  the  components  required  for 
biofilm  formation  such  as  the  extracellular  DNase  (Sda1). 
Taken  together  these  data  demonstrate  a  potential  mecha-
nism that GAS may utilize to transition from mild to severe 
infections.  Whilst  this  model  is  preliminary,  further  investi-
gations  into  the  downstream  effects  of  the  srv  mutation  on 
the expression of other extracellular virulence factors such as 
the Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (Sic) and its effect 
on GAS biofilm formation and virulence could provide new 
insights  into  the  role  of  biofilm  dispersal  in  invasive  GAS 
infection [77]. 

2.2.2. Quorum Sensing 

  Quorum Sensing (QS), a hallmark feature of many bacte-
rial  biofilms,  has  also  been  noted  for  GAS  biofilms.  Three 
GAS quorum sensing systems have been described: Strepto-
coccal invasion locus (Sil), regulatory gene of glucosyltrans-
ferase (Rgg), and LuxS/autoinducer-2.  

Sil has been linked to regulating genes involved in inva-
sive disease [56]. SilC  is a  signaling peptide of Sil,  and has 
been  linked  to  the  ability  of  GAS  to  spread  in  soft  tissues 
[78]. Importantly, SilC has been shown to have a role in QS 
for GAS biofilm formation [39, 57]. Using safranin-staining, 
an  isogenic  emm14  silC  mutant  showed  reduced  adherence 
to surfaces coated with fibronectin, fibrinogen,  and polysty-
rene  surfaces,  relative  to  the  wild-type  strain,  but  this  was 
not  statistically  significant  [39].  An  isogenic  emm18  silC 
mutant  exhibited  reduced  adherence  to  collagen  type  I  and 
IV  substrates,  relative  to  the  wild-type  strain,  but  this  was 
also not statistically significant. SEM analysis of the emm14 
and emm18 silC mutants revealed phenotypic changes in the 
strain  relative  to  the  wild-type.  The  emm14,  silC  mutant 
biofilm surface displayed more clefts than the wild-type ana-
logue  whilst  the  emm18  silC  mutant  displayed  a  thinner 
biofilm with  a patchy appearance, whilst its wild-type  com-
parator formed a solid and thick biofilm [39, 79]. 

  Conversely,  in a  study by Thenmozhi, et al. [57], it was 
suggested that strains from different serotypes form biofilms 
regardless  of  the  presence  of  the  silC  gene.  Crystal  violet 
staining of biofilms grown from strains of 11 different sero-
types  distinguished  M56,  M65,  M74,  M89,  M100,  and  st38 
as biofilm formers and M49, M63, M88.3, M122, and st2147 
as  non-biofilm  formers.  These  biofilms  were  grown  under 
static conditions on uncoated polystyrene. These strains were 
screened  for  the  presence  of  silC  which  present  in  only 
M100, M74, and st38 from the biofilm formers and the non-
biofilm former  M122. Serotypes lacking silC were  the most 
proficient biofilm producers under these conditions suggest-
ing  that  the  involvement  of  SilC  in  QS  is  not  required  for 
biofilm formation in all strains. 

  The Rgg QS system is one of the most conserved systems 
among Firmicutes, universally existing among all species of 
Streptococcus.  Within  this  large  family  of  regulatory  pro-
teins,  many  paralogs  exist.  For  GAS,  biofilm  formation, 
biofilm  development,  and  virulence  is  controlled  by  the 
Rgg2/Rgg3 system in response to the short hydrophobic pep-
tides  SHP2  and  SHP3  [80].  The  effects  of  SHP  have  been 
witnessed in GAS biofilm development, with potentiation of 
surface-associated  biofilms  forming  in  concentrations  of 
synthetic  SHP  pheromone  as  low  as  5  nM  [55].  Rgg-SHP-
mediated  QS  has  also  been  hypothesized  to  promote  inter-
species  signaling  between  common  residents  of  the  naso-
pharynx;  S.  pneumoniae,  S.  dysgalactiae,  and  GAS  [80]. 
Interspecies  signaling  utilizing  the  orthologous  Rgg/SHP 
systems has been further investigated and shown to be bidi-
rectional  between  GAS,  Group  B  Streptococcus,  and  Strep-
tococcus dysgalactiae subsp.  Equisimilis. However, the role 
of this particular bidirectional communication using QS sys-
tems  in  multispecies  biofilm  formation  and  virulence  war-
rants further analysis [81].  

  Lastly,  Autoinducer-2  synthesized  by  LuxS,  an  enzyme 
expressed  by  several  biofilm-forming  bacteria,  including 
GAS, is necessary for biofilm formation [56]. Although this 
QS  system  has  yet  to  be  thoroughly  investigated,  it  is 
thought  to  control  some  virulence  mechanisms  (e.g.  hemo-
lytic  and  proteolytic  activity),  and  importantly  emm  gene 
expression  and  SpeB  production,  which  have  both  been 
shown to affect biofilm formation and development [82-85]. 

2.2.3. Modelling GAS Biofilms 

  Current  knowledge  of  biofilm  formation,  basic  hallmark 
characteristics,  physiology,  and  antimicrobial  resistance  has 
come  primarily  from  in  vitro  biofilm  modelling.  In  vitro 
models aim to depict conditions similar to those in vivo con-
sidering  variables  such  as  growth  rate,  flow  rate,  nutrient 
availability,  gas  concentrations,  and  substratum.  The  sim-
plest  and  earliest  biofilm  model  was  liquid  growth  media 
inoculated with bacteria left to colonize a solid surface [86]. 
However,  higher  throughput  models  have  since  been  devel-
oped  such  as  multi-well  systems  using  various  abiotic 
growth  surfaces  (glass,  plastic,  silicone,  and  polystyrene). 
Although these are  cost-effective and somewhat  easy to  im-
plement,  the  biofilms  formed  are  limited  in  their  ability  to 
truly mimic  those  in an in  vivo setting [9].  Moreover, while 
in  vitro  GAS  biofilms  have  provided  important  insight  into 
GAS  biofilm  formation,  GAS  colonization  and  infection  in 
vivo  is  a  complex  process  involving  multiple  interactions

with  the host. Such interactions  initiate  and  alter  GAS gene 
expression in a way that is difficult to mimic in most in vitro 
models.  This  was  demonstrated  in  a  study  showing  that  a 
lack  of  host  factors  resulted  in  highly  differential  virulence 
gene expression between biofilms produced in vitro to those 
present  in vivo [44]. The  study highlights the importance of 
mimicking  the  host  environment  as  closely  as  possible.  Al-
ternative approaches to biofilm formation include the use of 
epithelial cells as the substratum for GAS biofilm growth to 
compensate  for  host  factor  presence.  However,  the  toxicity 
of  broth  grown  GAS  to  cultured  eukaryotic  cells  renders 
long term biofilm-epithelial modelling difficult [87]. A more 
recent  study  that  utilized  both  live  and  prefixed  epithelial 
substrata  successfully  integrated  aspects  of  the  necessary 
environment, closely mirroring in vivo GAS colonization [9]. 
Specifically,  GAS  was  able  to  form  micro-colonies  resem-
blant of biofilms in vivo, as opposed to dense biofilm sheets 
typical  of  biofilms  grown  on  abiotic  surfaces.  Additionally, 
biofilms were non-toxic to the live human keratinocyte sub-
stratum. Overall, this study confirmed that an epithelial sub-
stratum  potentiates  biofilm  formation,  with  bacterial  mor-
phology  resemblant  of  in  vivo  GAS  biofilms,  a  result  not 
achievable for GAS biofilms grown on abiotic surfaces  like 
glass or plastic. Another in vitro study investigated the abil-
ity of 2 dominating emm-types involved with NSTI, (emm 1 
strain  8157,  and  emm  3  strains  5626  and  8003)  to  form 
biofilm  using  standard  polystyrene  and  glass  surfaces  [16]. 
Both  emm  3  strains  formed  biofilm  on  uncoated  and  fi-
bronectin-coated  polystyrene  surfaces.  In  contrast,  only 
strain 5626 was able to form a biofilm on glass surfaces. The 
emm  1  strain  8157  did  not  form  biofilm  under  the  tested 
plate conditions. A 3D organotypic skin model was also gen-
erated using human keratinocyte cells (N/TERT-1) and nor-
mal  human  dermal  fibroblasts  (NHDF)  to  mimic  key  ana-
tomical/functional  features  of  the  skin.  This  model  had  the 
advantage of dermal and epidermal layers being formed, and 
key epidermal structural proteins included. The emm 1 strain 
8157 and emm 3 strains 5626 and 8003 were all able to initi-
ate tissue infection in this model, and after 8 hours of incuba-
tion, the bacteria were found to predominate the stratum cor-
neum.  Upon  further  incubation,  the  bacteria  were  dispersed 
throughout  the  whole  tissue,  with  bacterial  aggregates  that 
developed  typical  of  biofilm  upon  immunostaining.  Further 
investigation  of  these  aggregates  utilizing  confocal  laser 
scanning  microscopy  confirmed  the  presence  of  hallmark 
biofilm  features  of  the  EPS  including;  exopolysaccharides, 
lipids  and  extracellular  DNA  associated  with  the  bacterial 
community  [16].  At  present,  GAS  existing  in  the  biofilm 
phenotype  is  not  recognized  as  a  potential  component  of 
NSTIs. This comprehensive study supports the need for fur-
ther investigation into the role biofilms play in GAS NSTIs, 
and by extension, other GAS associated skin infections. Fu-
ture studies using similar epithelial-GAS biofilm models are 
necessary,  with  a  focus  on  establishing  the  interaction  be-
tween  GAS  and  the  local  resident  microbiome  to  provide  a 
more  accurate  understanding  of  the  underlying  mechanisms 
in which GAS may adhere, colonize and persist in the host. 

gions of the tonsils, pharynx, and oesophagus which cumula-
tively  play  an  important  role  in  human  health  and  disease 
[88]. As found by Lemon, et al. [89], the phylum-level com-
position  of  bacterial  residents  of  the  oropharynx  is  distinct 
from  the  nasal  cavity.  Moreover,  differences  in  relative 
abundance  profiles  of  phyla  vary  between  the  pharynx  and 
saliva.  These  differences  highlight  how  each  niche  environ-
ment,  although  quite  interconnected,  supports  discrete  mi-
crobial populations [90]. 

  Commonly found species that predominate this niche are 
from  the  genera  Prevotella,  Capnocytophaga,  Campylobac-
ter,  Veillonella,  Streptococcus,  Neisseria,  Rothia,  Actinoo-
myces, and Haemophilus [90, 91]. This site is also colonized 
by important human pathogens such  as GAS, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Haemophilus  influen-
zae, Neisseria  meningitidis, and  Moraxella  catarrhalis  [92, 
93].  However,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  studies,  much 
remains  unknown  about  the  interspecies  interactions  that 
occur in this rich, polymicrobial ecosystem. 

2.3.1. Polymicrobial Biofilms of the Oropharynx 

  Currently, very  little is known regarding the  interactions 
between  species  of  the  oropharyngeal  microbiome,  and  the 
opportunistic bacterial pathogen GAS [38, 94]. It is possible 
that the overall biofilm architecture/organization and relative 
species  abundance  within  these  polymicrobial  communities 
may  alter  in  a  strain-specific  manner  [95-97].  Additionally, 
the polymicrobial biofilm may offer GAS numerous survival 
and  competitive  advantages  such  as;  metabolic  cooperation, 
complex QS systems, an increased gene pool, efficient DNA 
sharing,  by-product  sharing,  cross-protection,  protective  ad-
vantages  to  host  immunity  and  antimicrobials,  alongside 
numerous  other  synergies  [98].  This  is  especially  important 
when  we  consider  the  antibiotic  treatment  failure  rate,  and 
persistence/recurrence  of  GAS  pharyngitis.  An  example  of 
this  is  the  co-operation  between  GAS  and  co-pathogenic 
organisms  such  as  Haemophilus  parainfluenzae,  S.  aureus, 
and  Moraxella  catarrhalis.  It  has  been  theorized  that  these 
bacteria  collectively  contribute  to  antibiotic  insensitivity 
through  their  combined  β-lactamase  production  when  in  a 
polymicrobial  biofilm  [5].  Another  study  demonstrated  that 
in a polymicrobial biofilm of Streptococcus oralis and GAS, 
S.  oralis  was  the  initial  colonizer  and  formed  the  bottom 
layer  of  the  biofilm,  while  the  GAS  M49  strain,  which  was 
otherwise  a  poor  biofilm  former,  was  more  able  to  form  a 
biofilm on top. This study additionally found that when both 
S.  oralis  and  Streptococcus  salivarius  formed  the  bottom 
biofilm layer, they collectively displayed a growth inhibitory 
effect on GAS via bacteriocin secretion [38]. Overall, efforts 
are needed toward designing models enabling the assessment 
of  how  pathogens  like  GAS  interact  with  the  local  micro-
biome  of  the  throat.  Characterizing  these  interactions  may 
provide  a  greater  understanding  of  the  GAS  colonization 
process,  and  may  also  help  to  identify  more  targeted  treat-
ments or preventative strategies. 

CONCLUSION 

2.3. The Oropharyngeal Microbiome 

  Over 700 different bacterial species have been recovered 
from  the  microbiome  of  the  oral  cavity  and  contiguous  re-

  Whilst  it  is  evident  that  there  have  been  some  advances 
in the understanding of GAS biofilms, it is clear that further 
characterization of the biofilm phenotype is needed in order 
to  define  its  role  in  GAS  pathogenesis.  Specifically,  further

study  is  needed  to  improve  the  current  understanding  of 
GAS as a mono-species biofilm, particularly with respect to 
the  virulence  factors  involved,  and  their  roles  in  the  GAS 
biofilm phenotype. Improved models of GAS biofilm forma-
tion  that  closely  mimic  in  vivo  conditions  will  ensure  that 
biofilms  generated  in  the  lab  more  accurately  reflect  those 
occurring during a clinical infection. Moreover, an improved 
understanding of the way in which GAS interacts, and forms 
biofilms  with  a  broader  array  of  bacterial  species  typical  of 
the local host environment is also necessary. Taken together, 
this  valuable  information  may  provide  better  insight  into 
GAS antibiotic treatment failure and the mechanisms utilized 
by GAS biofilms that may underpin recurrent and persistent 
GAS infections. In turn, such findings will serve as potential 
avenues for better treatment modalities and therapeutics. 

AUTHORS PERSPECTIVE 

  Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a Gram-positive human 
pathogen, known to cause an array of diseases ranging from 
mild,  superficial  infections,  to  more  serious  invasive  infec-
tions,  and  numerous  autoimmune  sequelae.  There  is  evi-
dence  to suggest  that GAS forms biofilms both  in vitro and 
in  vivo.  Current  understanding  of  the  biofilm  phenotype  in 
GAS  pathogenesis  and  disease  progression  is  limited  and 
further  characterization  is  needed.  A  greater  understanding 
of  GAS  biofilms,  may  support  the  development  of  novel 
therapeutics  and  treatment  strategies  that  specifically  target 
GAS in the biofilm phenotype.
