ABSTRACT The steps involved during the bioﬁlm growth cycle
include attachment to a substrate followed by more permanent
adherence of the microorganisms, microcolony arrangement,
and cell detachment required for the dissemination of single or
clustered cells to other organ systems. Various methods have
been developed for bioﬁlm detection and quantitation.
Bioﬁlm-producing microorganisms can be detected in tissue
culture plates, using silicone tubes and staining methods,
and by visual assessment using scanning electron microscopy or
confocal scanning laser microscopy. Quantitative measurement
of bioﬁlm growth is determined by using methods that include
dry cell weight assays, colony-forming-unit counting,
DNA quantiﬁcation, or XTT 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-
sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium
hydroxide reduction assay. Upon infection, innate immune
defense strategies are able to establish an immediate response
through eﬀector mechanisms mediated by immune cells,
receptors, and several humoral factors. We present an overview
of the life cycle of bioﬁlms and their diversity, detection methods
for bioﬁlm development, and host immune responses to
pathogens. We then focus on current concepts in bacterial
and fungal bioﬁlm immune evasion mechanisms. This appears
to be of particular importance because the use of host
immune responses may represent a novel therapeutic
approach against bioﬁlms.

INTRODUCTION

Historically, microbial organisms have been grown in
pure liquid cultures as free-ﬂoating “planktonic” cells,
promoting the general theory of the unicellular lifestyle.
However, in the late 1970s, Costerton et al. (1) dem-
onstrated that groups of bacteria were embedded in a
highly hydrated polysaccharide matrix that mediated

adhesion to solid aquatic surfaces. Several years later,
the same research team called these cellular communi-
ties “bioﬁlms,” deﬁned as a functionally heterogeneous
aggregate of microcolonies or single cells encased in a
matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric mole-
cules that could adhere either to organic, abiotic surfaces
or to each other (2). Microbial bioﬁlms can develop
into highly organized structures containing channels
in which water, nutrients, and metabolic waste can be
transported. Adhesion to substrates or surfaces induces
expression of a large number of genes, while cell aggre-
gates in different regions in a bioﬁlm exhibit different
gene expression proﬁles that regulate bioﬁlm develop-
ment and maturation processes (3, 4). A large amount
of research since the 1980s has brought to light the
theory that most, if not all, bacteria and fungi can form
bioﬁlms as a survival mechanism in hostile environ-
ments, providing protection from biotic and abiotic
stresses (5–8). Prime candidates for cell attachment and
bioﬁlm growth are surfaces exposed to or containing
moisture and some nutrients. Natural or man-made

substrates for cell attachment and bioﬁlm growth in-
clude river stones, oil and gas installations, ship hulls,
water pipes,
food-processing surfaces, contaminated
surgical instruments, indwelling medical devices, human
teeth, and infected wounds (9–11). In this chapter, we
will present an overview of the life cycle of bioﬁlms and
their diversity, detection methods for bioﬁlm develop-
ment, and host immune responses to pathogens. We will
then focus on current concepts in bacterial and fungal
bioﬁlm immune evasion mechanisms.

BIOFILM FORMATION

Although different model systems have been described
to deﬁne bioﬁlm development in bacteria and fungi,
the steps involved in the bioﬁlm growth cycle are fairly
universal with many common characteristics (Table 1).
In the human body, attachment to accessible human host
proteins is the ﬁrst step of bioﬁlm formation and is de-
pendent either on the hydrophobic nature of microbial
surfaces or on speciﬁc cell surface molecules that enable
adherence to host proteins. For example, Staphylococ-
cus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus express
MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recogniz-
ing adhesive matrix molecules) that have domains for
noncovalent attachment to peptidoglycan moieties and
also harbor binding sites for ﬁbronectin, ﬁbrinogen,
laminin, collagen IV, and other human matrix proteins
(12, 13). For bacteria with ﬂagellar motility, swimming
cells attach to the surface ﬁrst transiently and then
permanently, expressing conditionally synthesized ad-
hesive proteins to form a monolayer bioﬁlm (14, 15).
Like the exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix of bacterial
bioﬁlms, the polysaccharide capsule of Cryptococcus
neoformans, a human pathogenic fungus, promotes
the attachment process to prosthetic medical devices,
whereas cell-surface glycoproteins facilitate adhesion
of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (16–19).
Attachment is promoted by several environmental sig-
nals, such as changes in nutrient concentrations, pH,
ﬂow velocity of surrounding body ﬂuids (urine, blood,
saliva), temperature, oxygen concentration, osmolality,
and iron.

TABLE 1 Steps in the bioﬁlm growth cycle

Attachment of microorganisms to surfaces
Adherence
Microcolony arrangement
Detachment and dissemination of single or clustered cells to other
organ systems

The next phase of bioﬁlm formation is characterized
by a microcolony arrangement on the attached surface
produced by the multiplication of free-ﬂoating cells;
motility is reduced and exopolysaccharide production is
activated to trap nutrients and planktonic cells, whereas
signal molecules are secreted in a cell-density-dependent
manner to communicate and coordinate the cellular
responses through a process called quorum sensing. The
presence of farnesol, a quorum sensing molecule ﬁrst
described in C. albicans, has been found to inhibit the
yeast-to-mycelium conversion, enhancing active bud-
ding yeast production without compromising cellular
growth rates (20). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhamno-
lipids maintain bioﬁlm architecture by affecting the
attachment of bacterial cells to substrates and cell-to-
cell-interactions. When cell density increases during
the later stages of the maturation phase, rhamnolipids
maintain open channels between cellular aggregates to
distribute certain types and amounts of nutrients to
support cell growth (21).

Another way to trap both nutrients and planktonic
cells once a critical bioﬁlm mass has been achieved is
the production and secretion of extracellular matrix
predominantly composed of polysaccharides, proteins,
and extracellular DNA (eDNA). This matrix promotes
initial cell adhesion, triggers polysaccharide formation,
and serves as a support that links molecules together in
the bioﬁlm matrix, thus inﬂuencing the structure and
organization of mature bioﬁlms. Extracellular DNA is
an important component of Aspergillus fumigatus bio-
ﬁlms that originates from either fungal autolysis (22) or
is externally supplied from human neutrophils attracted
to the infected site (23, 24).

The last phase of bioﬁlm formation is cell detachment,
which is required for the dissemination of single or
clustered cells to other organ systems. Factors that could
include sheer mechanical
contribute to cell dispersal
forces (blood ﬂow), enzymes that digest the extracellular
matrix, and nutrient limitation in a mature bioﬁlm. The
dispersed cell population of C. albicans displays yeast
morphology with different phenotypic characteristics
from their planktonic counterparts, including increased
adherence capacity, ﬁlamentation, bioﬁlm formation,
and increased pathogenicity to establish new foci of in-
fection (25). In staphylococci, quorum sensing–controlled
phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) participate in establish-
ing bioﬁlm architecture as well as detachment processes
using a mechanism similar to that used by P. aeruginosa
but with different effector molecules. PSMs are part of a
novel toxin family with multiple roles in staphylococcal
pathogenesis, because they promote formation of bioﬁlm

and regrowth, contributing to bacterial dissemination.
During the dispersal phase, PSMs act as surfactant-
like peptides that inhibit cell-to-cell interactions at the
surface of the bioﬁlm, leading to the detachment of bac-
terial cells at the ﬂuid-bioﬁlm interphase and the subse-
quent systemic spread of bioﬁlm-associated infections
(26, 27).

Natural bioﬁlms in most environments,

including
human disease, tend to coexist forming polymicrobial
communities (28, 29). The interactions that take place
between fungal and/or bacterial species can either be
synergistic or antagonistic in nature (30). An example
of a mutually beneﬁcial interaction is a phenomenon
called “coaggregation symbiosis” that is observed be-
tween C. albicans and S. aureus, whereby Candida hy-
phal penetration through epithelial layers provides a
route of entry for staphylococci. Moreover, the observed
hyphal-mediated increased pathogenicity of S. aureus
may be attributed not only to the physical interactions
but also to the differential regulation of virulence fac-
tors produced during polymicrobial growth (31). Dif-
ferent microbial species in a single bioﬁlm community
could offer passive resistance, metabolic cooperation,
quorum sensing systems, and genotypic variability
that give an advantage to counteract adverse environ-
mental conditions (32). In contrast, the interactions be-
tween A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa (both present in
the cystic ﬁbrosis [CF] lung microbiome) is described as
being antagonistic. A. fumigatus bioﬁlm formation is
inhibited by direct contact with a P. aeruginosa–secreted
heat-stable soluble factor, suggesting that small diffus-
ible molecules can interfere with ﬁlamentous fungal
growth in polymicrobial environments (33). Although
in recent years investigations have shifted to polymicro-
bial bioﬁlms, there is considerable knowledge yet to
be gained in our understanding of microbial cohabita-
tion and microbes’ interaction with the host to con-
the impact of polymicrobial bioﬁlm-associated
trol
diseases.

DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION
METHODS OF BIOFILM FORMATION
Various methods have been developed for bioﬁlm de-
tection and quantitation (Table 2). They include staining
and microscopic visualization of bioﬁlm structure as
well as quantitation of the numbers of bioﬁlm-associated
cells in situ or after detachment of microbial cells from
the substrate. Bioﬁlm-producing microorganisms are
also detected by methods that include growth in tissue

culture wells or silicone tube bioﬁlm reactors, followed
by staining with Congo red or crystal violet stains.
These stained bioﬁlms can be visually assessed by scan-
ning electron microscopy or confocal scanning laser
microscopy, which is most effective for studying an
intact bioﬁlm’s three-dimensional architecture (34–36).
Quantitative measurement of bioﬁlm growth is deter-
mined by using methods that include determining dry cell
weight assays, assessing colony forming unit by plating
on solid media, DNA quantiﬁcation, or an XTT 2,3-
bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)
carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide reduction assay
(34, 37, 38). The latter method is colorimetric and uses
XTT, a colorless or slightly yellow compound that when
reduced to a formazan product becomes bright orange.
The oxidation-reduction process is initiated by mito-
chondrial dehydrogenases of metabolically active cells.
The colorimetric change is proportional to the number of
living cells and can be quantiﬁed spectrophotometrically.
The biodiversity and abundance of bioﬁlm-associated mi-
croorganisms in polymicrobial communities is detected
using a combination of molecular diagnostics based on
PCR, sequencing technologies, and advanced mathe-
matical algorithms to identify the bioﬁlm-producing
microorganisms present and to analyze the copy number
of each organism relative to the total number of copies
for all organisms (39–41).

HOST DEFENSES AGAINST BIOFILMS

Upon infection, innate immune defense strategies are
able to establish an immediate response through effec-
tor mechanisms mediated by immune cells, receptors,
and several humoral factors (Table 3). The main role
of humoral
factors, such as mannose binding lec-
tins, collectins, complement, and antibodies, is to bind
invading microbes and promote receptor-mediated rec-
ognition and phagocytosis by cells of the innate im-
mune system. Pathogen-associated molecular structures
found on the surface of microbes are recognized by

speciﬁc receptors on natural killer cells or professional
phagocytes consisting of polymorphonuclear neutro-
phils (PMNs), mononuclear leukocytes (macrophages),
and dendritic cells (DCs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
the best-deﬁned immune sensors of invading pathogens
on the surface of phagocytes, initiate a cascade of sig-
naling pathways that induce phagocytosis, secretion
of antimicrobial products generated in phagocytes by
oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms, release of pro-
and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, or other factors that
contribute to the activation, maturation, and immuno-
regulation of adaptive immune responses. DCs are the
main cell populations that bridge innate and adaptive
immunity, because recruitment by inﬂammatory signals
leads to DC accumulation at injured or infected sites
to capture, internalize, and present microbial cell frag-
ments to naïve T cells in the lymph nodes. TLRs and
C-type lectin receptors contribute to the recognition and
activation of speciﬁc DC programs to decode the struc-
tural information of the antigens captured and to con-
vert it into different T-cell immune responses (42–45).
Thus, early phases of immune response help to control
excessive propagation of pathogens, while activation
of proper T cell subsets leads to long-lived protective
immunity.

In most of the studies conducted to date, host-
pathogen interactions concern bacteria and fungi in their
free-living planktonic state. However, despite the pau-
city of information, recent studies have begun to inves-
tigate immune responses to bioﬁlms. Antimicrobial
factors, such as lactoferrin and the human cationic host
defense peptide LL-37 found at mucosal surfaces or

in secondary granules of PMN, when used in vitro at
very low concentrations, strongly inhibit formation of
P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms. Lactoferrin, as an iron-binding
glycoprotein, reduces the iron supply necessary for
bioﬁlm growth and promotes twitching motility (46),
whereas LL-37 reduces the initial attachment phase,
increases surface motility, and interferes with the quo-
rum sensing system of P. aeruginosa (47). However,
bacteria are known to counteract such host defense
processes by secreting proteases able to degrade both
lactoferrin and LL-37 (48, 49). Although speciﬁc im-
mune receptors for the bioﬁlm mode of growth have
not been identiﬁed, the active involvement of PMNs
against bioﬁlms is demonstrated by the increased oxygen
depletion caused by enhanced oxidative burst, by the
increased glucose uptake by PMN in CF lungs, and
by the high concentration of L-lactate in the sputum of
CF patients with chronic lung infection (50). It has been
shown that upon contact of PMNs with S. aureus bio-
ﬁlms, a decrease in bioﬁlm mass is caused by phagocy-
tosis, rapid degranulation of lactoferrin and elastase,
and ﬁnally, DNA release (51). Time-lapse video mi-
croscopy has documented migration of PMNs into
S. aureus bioﬁlms, and clearance of bacterial cells within
the bioﬁlm by phagocytosis is shown to be dependent
on bioﬁlm maturation, because young bioﬁlms are more
susceptible to PMN antimicrobial functions compared
to mature bioﬁlms (52). In contrast to planktonic cells
of S. epidermidis, adherence of PMNs to bioﬁlms and
phagocytosis seems to be opsonization-independent,
suggesting that bioﬁlms could contain PMN signaling
molecules (53).

phagocytes enhance the ability of C. albicans to form
bioﬁlms and that these phagocytes appear as unstimu-
lated rounded cells, inducing signiﬁcantly less damage
to bioﬁlms than their planktonic counterparts (54, 55).
C. neoformans, an encapsulated fungus that can cause
meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients,
shows resistance to oxidative stress, but it becomes
considerably more susceptible to cationic antimicrobial
peptides when switching to the bioﬁlm mode of growth.
Defensins with higher net positive charges (β-defensin-1,
β-defensin-3) interact strongly with negatively charged
bioﬁlm surfaces, while their hydrophobic characteristics
enable them to enter the cells’ membranes and create
temporary pores through which cell contents leak,
leading to cell death. In contrast, defensins with lower
net positive charges (α-defensin-3 and magainin-1) are
less efﬁcient against bioﬁlms, implying that the greater
afﬁnity to bioﬁlms results in increased bioﬁlm suscepti-
bility (56).

C. neoformans capsule is primarily composed of
glucuronoxylomannan, a polysaccharide present
in
large amounts in the extracellular bioﬁlm matrix and
for this reason indispensible for bioﬁlm formation.
Moreover, it has been shown that anti–C. neoformans
antibodies have a multitude of protective functions,
including enhancement of animal survival against cryp-
tococcosis, promotion of phagocytosis, antigen pre-
sentation, complement activation, and modulation of
immune protein expression. Testing the hypothesis that
antibodies could also interfere with bioﬁlm production,
Martinez and Casadevall demonstrated that monoclonal
antibodies raised against glucuronoxylomannan inhibit
bioﬁlm formation, suggesting that humoral
immune
responses could be important to the prevention of bio-
ﬁlm formation. In the clinical setting, administration
of protective antibodies could present a valuable alter-
native in the management of bioﬁlm-associated diseases
(17).

HOW BIOFILMS OF BACTERIA AND
FUNGI EVADE HOST DEFENSES
Staphylococcus spp.
Staphylococcus spp. are among the leading causes of
health care facility– and community-associated infec-
tions. S. epidermidis and S. aureus are frequent etiologic
factors of bioﬁlm-associated infections on indwelling
medical devices as well as chronic and recalcitrant infec-
tions such as endocarditis, periodontitis, rhinosinusitis,

How Bioﬁlms Evade Host Defenses

and osteomyelitis (57). The emergence of drug-resistant
strains, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus, further
accentuates their therapeutic difﬁculty. While the bulk of
the available information on bioﬁlms concerns bioﬁlm
development, the host immune responses against bioﬁlm
infections remain largely unidentiﬁed.

Initial studies of medically relevant S. aureus bioﬁlms
showed that human leukocytes are able to effectively
penetrate the bioﬁlm, possibly by using the nutrient
channels that exist in mature bioﬁlms; however, leuko-
cytes exhibit impaired phagocytosis and show a decreased
ability to kill the bacteria (58). Subsequent studies using
more sophisticated methods demonstrated that PMNs
are able to clear Staphylococcus spp. bioﬁlms by phago-
cytosis (51, 52, 59). Furthermore, immature bioﬁlms were
more sensitive to phagocytosis compared to mature ones,
although mature bioﬁlms are not entirely immune to
PMN attack (52). By comparison, macrophages did not
show appreciable phagocytosis of S. aureus bioﬁlms. Of
note, macrophages were capable of engulﬁng disrupted
bioﬁlm material, suggesting that the size and/or physical
complexity of bioﬁlm ultrastructure are responsible for
their recalcitrance to phagocytosis (60).

The opsonization of S. aureus bioﬁlms with immu-
noglobulin G did not affect the adherence of PMNs
to the bioﬁlms; however, it increased the clearance of
bioﬁlm, possibly through upregulated oxygen radical
production in PMNs (61). It seems that bioﬁlm matrix
can protect bacteria from antibody-mediated phagocy-
tosis (62).

Another mechanism utilized by S. aureus bioﬁlms to
evade host immunity, which may explain their in vivo
is the macrophage dysfunction and cell
persistence,
death caused upon contact with the bioﬁlm itself. It
was noted that macrophages showed a differential sen-
sitivity to cell death based on their physical distance
from the bioﬁlm surface, with macrophages most inti-
mately associated with bioﬁlm being dead, while mac-
rophages that remained above the bioﬁlm surface
remained viable (60). Among the potential mechanisms
proposed to account for this phenomenon is the phe-
nomenon of metabolic “layering” within the bioﬁlm
(63). Regions of anaerobic and aerobic microenviron-
ments within the bioﬁlm, bacterial-inﬂuenced ﬂuctua-
tions in pH, and macrophage survival may be affected
due to the release of bacterially produced toxic by-
products of metabolism. Furthermore, the bioﬁlm may
contain lytic toxins, which may lead to cell death.

Using a mouse model of catheter-associated bioﬁlm
infection, it was demonstrated that several inﬂamma-
tory signals responsible for macrophage and neutrophil

recruitment (CCL2 and CXXL2, respectively) and acti-
vation (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin
[IL]-1β) were signiﬁcantly reduced in bioﬁlm-infected
tissues compared to the wound healing response elicited
by sterile catheters (60). The role of IL-1β is potentially
mediated through the MyD88-dependent pathway and
can reduce bioﬁlm development but is not sufﬁcient
to eradicate staphylococcal bioﬁlms (63). Additionally,
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression was
decreased and arginase-1, a key enzyme involved in
collagen biosynthesis, was increased in macrophages
surrounding the bioﬁlm. These ﬁndings would be ex-
pected to skew the cellular response away from bacterial
killing to favor ﬁbrosis and could represent another
mechanism to account for the ability of bioﬁlms to evade
clearance (60, 63). Further in vivo data showed that
S. aureus bioﬁlms could evade TLR2 and TLR9 recog-
nition (60). While the mechanism responsible for TLR2/
TLR9 evasion is not known, it could be attributed to
ligand inaccessibility.

Current data collectively indicate that the persist-
ence of staphylococcal bioﬁlm could be attributed
to its ability to skew the immune response to favor
anti-inﬂammatory and pro-ﬁbrotic pathways. As such,
it has been shown that targeting macrophage pro-
inﬂammatory activity can represent a novel therapeutic
strategy to overcome the local immune inhibitory envi-
ronment created during bioﬁlm infections (64).

From the currently available data, one can deduce
that innate host defense cells may be able to recognize
Staphylococcus spp. bioﬁlms, migrate toward bioﬁlms,
and degrade bioﬁlms in vitro. However, the latter de-
pends greatly on the experimental conditions, namely
the Staphylococcus strain, bioﬁlm maturation phase,
opsonization with immunoglobulin, and the immune
cell population used. It is likely that the unique proper-
ties of Staphylococcus spp. bioﬁlms circumvent tradi-
tional antimicrobial pathways. Additional studies are
warranted to investigate the mechanisms that lead to
host defense impairment upon contact with Staphylo-
coccus spp. bioﬁlms.

Pseudomonas spp.
The opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa has drawn
special attention in the bioﬁlm ﬁeld due to its role in
chronic and recalcitrant infections, particularly lung in-
fection of CF patients, ventilator-associated pneumonia,
chronic wounds, otitis media, and medical device–
related infections. In humans, infection by P. aeruginosa,
and subsequent bioﬁlm formation, invariably occurs in
association with an exuberant inﬂammatory response.

Pseudomonas bioﬁlm–related infections seem to follow
the current dogma regarding host defense mechanisms
in eradicating bioﬁlms
where immune responses fail
(65).

Initial

studies using a chemiluminescence assay
showed that while bioﬁlms of P. aeruginosa were ca-
pable of activating the oxidative burst response of
PMNs, this response was reduced by about 25% com-
pared to planktonic cells (66). In vitro microscopic evi-
dence suggests that the normal migratory behavior
of phagocytes is disrupted by P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms.
The innate cells settle into bioﬁlms but do not appear
to be capable of migrating from the point of contact
even though they appear to mount a respiratory burst,
degranulate, and retain their phagocytic and secretory
activity. The mechanism by which the bioﬁlms immo-
bilize neutrophils (yet they are still capable of phago-
cytosing bacteria) is not known (67). It is possible
that exotoxins or other components produced by
P. aeruginosa and immune cells, respectively, may play
a role (46, 67). Others suggest that P. aeruginosa bio-
ﬁlm tolerance to PMNs is quorum sensing dependent
(68).

It has also been reported that P. aeruginosa bioﬁlm
formation is increased by 2- to 3.5-fold in the presence of
PMNs (69, 70). The mechanism of bioﬁlm enhancement
by PMNs was attributed to PMN-generated polymers
comprised of actin and DNA (69). This is consistent with
the clinical ﬁnding of higher numbers of necrotic PMNs
detected in CF lungs infected with P. aeruginosa com-
pared with other bacterial infections (71). Lactoferrin, a
common secretory component of human neutrophil
granules, has been shown to inhibit P. aeruginosa bio-
ﬁlm production (46). However, lactoferrin inhibitory
effect was not evident when the total content of neu-
trophil granules was combined with P. aeruginosa (69).
In this regard, it is likely that the role of lactoferrin
in microbial bioﬁlms is modulated by scavenging and
protease- or oxygen radical–mediated degradation by
P. aeruginosa and neutrophils (46, 67).

The pathogen-beneﬁcial effects of the bioﬁlm matrix
have been demonstrated in other studies (65, 72). The
exopolysaccharide alginate protects P. aeruginosa bio-
ﬁlm bacteria from leukocyte phagocytosis. In vitro
studies demonstrate that in the presence of the potent
leukocyte activator interferon-γ, human phagocytes
killed P. aeruginosa bioﬁlm bacteria lacking the ability
to produce the alginate exopolysaccharide (72). Of note,
the inability of innate cells to eliminate bioﬁlms is abol-
ished as soon as bioﬁlm cells are mechanically disrupted
into individual cells (65, 73).

of rhamnolipids (a class of glycolipids produced by
P. aeruginosa that are considered a key virulence de-
terminant acting under the control of the quorum sens-
ing system) in the host defense against PMNs, especially
in CF lung infection or other chronic infections (65, 74).
The activity of rhamnolipids was shown in vitro and
in vivo in pulmonary models, where P. aeruginosa bio-
ﬁlms produce a shield of excreted rhamnolipids that
protects from the bactericidal activity of PMNs (65,
75, 76). Accordingly, disabling the bioﬁlm shield of
rhamnolipids either by mutation or by treatment with
quorum sensing inhibitors leads to increased PMN-
mediated clearance of the bioﬁlm (65, 76). Rhamno-
lipids appear to be a crucial component of a vicious
self-enhancing cycle in which rhamnolipids induce ne-
crotic lysis of PMNs, and the lysed PMNs subsequently
cause more inﬂammation and in turn attract more
PMNs (65). The hypothesis of a “bioﬁlm shield” of
rhamnolipids which offers protection from the antibac-
terial activity of PMNs seems to contribute to bioﬁlm
infections of P. aeruginosa (65).

Candida spp.
While the interactions between the host immune system
and planktonic Candida cells have been extensively ex-
the corresponding bioﬁlm interactions are
amined,
largely unstudied (77). Initial studies showed that mono-
cytes inﬂuence the ability of C. albicans to form bioﬁlms.
Monocytes exert a bioﬁlm-enhancing effect, which has
been associated with a modulated immune response of
increased levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as
IL-1β and decreased levels of IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, I-309,
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (54). Overall, Candida
bioﬁlms appear to have an immunosuppressive effect,
because monocytes are unable to phagocytose fungal
cells in the maturing bioﬁlms and appear to be entrapped
within the bioﬁlm ultrastructure (54). Lack of mono-
cyte-mediated phagocytosis within bioﬁlms was also
observed for different stages of C. albicans bioﬁlm de-
velopment. Confocal scanning microscopy showed that
human phagocytes resemble unstimulated cells, present-
ing a rounded shape when in the presence of bioﬁlms
(55). This was also conﬁrmed by reduced cytokine
production in the bioﬁlm-phagocyte co-culture com-
pared to a planktonic cell-phagocyte mixture (55). How-
ever, the same phenomenon was not observed with
dislodged bioﬁlm cells (55). Consistently, mature Can-
dida bioﬁlms were more resistant to killing by leukocytes
than early bioﬁlms. Further, mature bioﬁlms failed
to trigger a reactive oxygen species response (78). The

How Bioﬁlms Evade Host Defenses

architecture of mature bioﬁlms and the presence of
β-glucans in the extracellular matrix represent an im-
portant innate immune evasion mechanism of C. albicans
bioﬁlms (55, 78).

Previous studies have unequivocally shown that in-
terferon-γ and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
enhance the antifungal activity of human PMNs against
planktonic Candida spp. (77). On the contrary, expo-
sure of C. albicans bioﬁlms to cytokine-activated PMNs
does not enhance bioﬁlm damage (77, 79). The increased
bioﬁlm damage induced by cytokine-activated PMNs
can be explained by the upregulatory activity of the
two cytokines to the number and/or to the afﬁnity of
the mannose and FcγR receptors on the surface of
the phagocytes leading to a more efﬁcient interaction
between PMNs and fungal targets. Knowing that kill-
ing of C. albicans requires ligation of the various host
immune receptors by C. albicans surface structures
(mannoproteins, mannans, or β-glucans) and knowing
the role of extracellular matrix to bioﬁlm immune eva-
sion, the lack of cytokine effectiveness was attributed
to the inability of the effector cells to recognize the
cells within the bioﬁlm (79). Nevertheless, the notion
of bioﬁlm recognition by the immune system appears to
be important. Large amounts of (1→3)-β-D-glucans are
found in the extracellular matrix of Candida bioﬁlms
in vitro and in vivo (80–82). In addition, Hyr1, which
surface glycosyl phosphatidylinositol–
encodes cell
anchored proteins, confers resistance to neutrophil kill-
ing in vitro and in an oral mucosal tissue bioﬁlm model
(81, 83).

In this regard, exposure of C. albicans bioﬁlms to
anidulafungin, an antifungal agent that causes height-
ened β-glucan exposure, was associated with a signiﬁ-
cant increase in phagocyte-mediated damage and a
larger pro-inﬂammatory response from phagocytes (55).
Furthermore, Candida spp. bioﬁlms were more suscep-
tible to the combined effect of anidulafungin with phago-
cytes compared to voriconazole with phagocytes (55,
79). These data underline the notion that echinocandins
(i.e., caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) have
immunomodulatory effects on host cells against bioﬁlms.

Other Organisms
Enterococci constitute an important cause of hospital-
acquired infections and become particularly pathogenic
in intensive care settings, in debilitated patients with
impaired immune systems, and in the elderly. Despite
the clinical importance of enterococci, little is known
about their interactions with immune cells (84, 85).
The prevailing notion that bioﬁlm cells encased in an

exopolysaccharide matrix are resistant to phagocytosis
by immune cells seems to contradict recent ﬁndings (86,
87). In vitro studies showed that immune cells are able to
phagocytose enterococcal cells recovered from bioﬁlms
as effectively as their planktonic counterparts (86, 87).
In addition, enterococcal bioﬁlms seem to elicit a dif-
ferential immune response relative to planktonic cells, in
that infected monocytes with enterococcal bioﬁlm cells
invoke less pro-inﬂammatory cytokine and chemokine
expression (86, 87). However, in vivo it is likely that the
complex involvement of multiple host factors may allow
bioﬁlm cells to circumvent host defenses, thus explaining
the persistence of bioﬁlm-related infections.

Aspergillus spp. are frequently isolated from the res-
piratory tract of patients with CF (88), where it causes
typical bioﬁlms and may be associated with deteriora-
invasive infection, or allergic
tion of lung function,
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Host defenses against
Aspergillus in the respiratory tract of CF patients have
been reviewed (89, 90). Like all bioﬁlms, Aspergillus
bioﬁlms are quite resistant to the antifungal activity
of PMNs and macrophages, the two major airway
phagocytes. Of note, Aspergillus downregulates vitamin
D receptor gene and protein expression in vitro and
in vivo. This is mediated by the fungal virulence factor
gliotoxin, an immune-evader and promoter of cellular
apoptosis. Reduced gliotoxin and IL-5 as well as IL-13
(Th2 cytokines) concentrations were detectable post–
itraconazole treatment in patients with CF and Asper-
gillus with concomitant increases in vitamin D airway
receptor expression (91).

HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENT FINDINGS
AND FUTURE QUESTIONS
A large range of bioﬁlm model systems has been devel-
oped; however, the technical challenges associated with
the growth and assessment of bioﬁlm development fur-
ther complicate the generalization of the results of var-
ious studies. In assessing the effects of host defenses
on microbial bioﬁlms, the experimental conditions, the
thickness, and the complexity of bioﬁlms should be
considered. A major challenge in bioﬁlm research is the
development of suitable models that effectively repro-
duce the host defense conditions at different infection
sites and that permit evaluation of the efﬁcacy of novel
antifungal treatment strategies under in vivo conditions
(92). Animal models of bioﬁlm formation represent an
invaluable alternative for improving our understanding
of bioﬁlm development inside the host, their resilience
to immune cells, and their interaction with the host

immune defense system. This appears to be of particular
importance because the use of host immune responses
may represent a novel therapeutic approach against
bioﬁlms (64).
