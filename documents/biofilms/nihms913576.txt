Abstract

Biofilm formation is a key virulence factor for a wide range of microorganisms that cause chronic 
infections. The multifactorial nature of biofilm development and drug tolerance imposes great 
challenges for the use of conventional antimicrobials, and indicates the need for multi-targeted or 
combinatorial therapies. In this review, we focus on current therapeutic strategies and those that

are under development that target vital structural and functional traits of microbial biofilms and 
drug tolerance mechanisms, including the extracellular matrix and dormant cells. We emphasize 
strategies that are supported by in vivo or ex vivo studies, highlight emerging biofilm-targeting 
technologies, and provide a rationale for multi-targeted therapies that are aimed at disrupting the 
complex biofilm microenvironment.

Initially reported as an arcane behaviour of bacterial populations, microbial biofilm 
formation is now recognized as a principle virulence factor in many localised chronic 
infections. Biofilm infections commonly recur after long periods of clinical quiescence. This 
is not primarily due to genetic resistance that arises by mutation, although the increased 
microbial cell density may favour transfer of resistance genes. Rather microorganisms that 
reside in biofilms may develop tolerance to traditional antibiotics or antimicrobial agents 
through metabolic dormancy or molecular persistence programmes. Moreover, the important 
role of the extracellular matrix in conferring antimicrobial tolerance to biofilms is being 
recognized1. Advances in multi-omic and imaging technologies have also revealed the 
remarkable complexity and spatial organization of polymicrobial biofilm infections2. 
Accordingly, our increased understanding of biofilms is rapidly changing the strategies used 
to treat these challenging infections (Fig. 1). Nonetheless, the control of biofilm formation 
and treating existing biofilms remains tenuous with few new therapeutic options currently 
available clinically.

Biofilm infections are not easily amenable to existing antimicrobial treatment or ‘single 
magic bullet’ approaches, because biofilm recalcitrance is a consequence of complex 
physical and biological properties with multiple microbial genetic and molecular factors, 
and also frequently involve multi-species interactions. A diverse range of microorganisms 
(Gram-positive and Gram-negative, motile and non-motile, aerobic, anaerobic and 
facultative bacteria, and fungi) form biofilms, which share many common features (Box 1). 
Although the ‘universal’ role of cell signalling in biofilm formation was revealed 20 years 
ago, signalling-based therapeutics have yet to be introduced for the clinical management of 
biofilm infections owing to the complexity in cell signalling networks. Similarly, the 
emergence of materials science, the development of surface modifications that incorporate 
technologies that target adhesion, as well as biomimicry or surface textures and chemistries 
from plants and animals3 were promising approaches to prevent microbial adherence and 
subsequent biofilm formation. Although many studies show statistical significant reductions 
in biofilm or alterations in biofilm structures in the laboratory, few were tested or validated 
using in vivo or human cell models to see if they translated to clinical significance. Many 
studies only report early time points, fail to use clinically relevant treatment regimens or do 
not consider the presence of molecularly complex host fluids or host cells at the site of 
biofilm infections. More recent approaches include targeting the extracellular polymeric 
substance (EPS) matrix. However, the variability in the composition of the EPS matrix and 
the interactions among the various components4 add new levels of complexity and provide 
challenges for the development of EPS-targeting therapeutics5.

Several excellent reviews discuss how microorganisms develop pathogenic biofilms and 
their protective mechanisms against antibiotics, antimicrobial agents and host innate

immunity 1,6,7. This Review focusses on the challenges facing the development of biofilm-
specific therapeutic strategies, how new insights into the chemical composition and structure 
of the EPS matrix, active biofilm dispersal pathways, and recognition of the role of dormant 
persister cells or slow-growing subpopulations in conferring antibiotic tolerance are being 
exploited to target biofilm infections. We also review developing technologies that promise 
to enhance the efficacy of current modalities or provide novel biofilm-targeting effects, 
including challenges to ensure biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy, which are both 
critical for clinical translatability. Where possible we focus on technologies that have shown 
efficacy in preclinical trials, or robust animal or human cell infection models. However, as 
not all potential biofilm-targeting therapeutic strategies can be discussed in detail, we 
provide a comprehensive list of current and prospective biofilm-targeting strategies, their 
developmental stage and a brief list of advantages and disadvantages in Supplemental Table 
S1.

Finally, we contend that treating biofilm infections requires combination therapies or those 
that target more than one component of the complex biofilm microenvironment, similar to 
tumouregenesis8. Importantly, biofilm infections reflect an interplay between the host and 
opportunistic pathogens, often within a complex microbiota. Polymicrobial biofilms pose an 
additional challenge, requiring antimicrobials that are effective against all pathogenic 
microorganisms in the biofilm and limiting the efficacy of species-specific biofilm-targeting 
strategies. All of these challenges contribute to why so few therapies have yet to be 
translated clinically.

Current therapeutic approaches

Many biofilm management strategies being devised in the clinic and used by surgeons, are 
largely based on an approach from cancer treatment (Box 2): early and aggressive irrigation 
and debridement for physically removal and local delivery of high and sustained 
antimicrobial chemotherapy9. Given the devastating consequences if a biofilm infection 
persists, surgeons are undertaking earlier and more aggressive treatment, including revisiting 
‘old’ last-resort antibiotics such as colistin10. Another established approach used for 
intravenous catheter-related infections is lock therapy11. Following a decision to treat rather 
than remove certain types of catheters, the potential to leave biofilms intact (but containing 
dead cells) includes the potential to promote colonization by other microorganisms. This 
illustrates a crucial point regarding biofilms: killing does not necessarily eradicate the 
biofilm. Therefore the challenge of using antimicrobial agents, which may kill 
microorganisms but leave behind other biofilm components, must be addressed.

Since understanding the mechanisms of biofilm formation derives primarily from how they 
form on solid surfaces, most clinical trials testing biofilm-targeting approaches or FDA-
approved therapeutics have focussed on indwelling medical devices. Current biofilm-
targeting technologies can be divided into two groups: physical-mechanical approaches (for 
example, high velocity spray and jet irrigators) that are aimed at biofilm disruption and 
removal; and surface-coating or eluting substrates, which can be impregnated with 
antibiotics and/or antimicrobials (for example, acrylic beads with absorbable antibiotic-
loaded bone cement to prevent orthopaedic infection12) for biofilm prevention; where higher

localised antibiotic concentrations can be achieved for longer periods by in situ antibiotic 
delivery compared to systemic administration. Several antimicrobial metal or inorganic 
coatings have also reached clinical application to prevent biofilm formation13. These include 
silver coating in endotracheal tubes, catheters, megaprostheses, wound dressings and copper 
alloys in hospital surfaces (supplemental Table S1). With respect to treating prexisiting 
biofilms, laboratory studies show that statistically significant reductions in biofilm viability 
can require extended incubation periods with high antibiotic concentrations. In situ release 
offers an important approach to achieve such high concentrations over long treatment 
periods 14,15. Although antibiotic-impregnated beads in bone cements or dental restorative 
materials were used before biofilm formation was recognized as a distinct etiological factor, 
they represent a class of technologies that are now being re-examined to gain better 
understanding of their effect in controlling biofilm infections.16

Mechanical disruption using water sprays and jets have been developed and used for 
pathogenic biofilm removal and for irrigation, including debridement of surgical site 
infections to remove necrotic tissue, exudates or dental biofilms. High-speed imaging has 
provided important information on fluid-biofilm-surface interactions and show that although 
a statistically significant amount of biofilm is removed from the area, the biofilm becomes 
fluidized and spreads across the surface17. The ability of biofilms to become fluidized 
probably explains the tenacity of bacteria on surfaces after pulsed lavage18 and may 
contribute to the low success rate of irrigation and debridement alone in treating 
periprosthetic infections. An advantage of water-based jets is that antimicrobial agents can 
be readily added so that the fluid doubles as a delivery device as well as creating mechanical 
forces acting on the biofilm. However, despite advances in biofilm specific-clinical 
therapies, particularly for indwelling devices, most approaches still entail conventional 
antibiotic-based therapy or topical broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

EPS-targeting strategies

The composition of the EPS matrix is temporally and structurally variable depending on the 
type of microorganism, local mechanical shear forces, substrate availability and the host 
environment. The EPS matrix promotes microbial adherence to a surface, cell-cell adhesion 
and aggregation19, and functions as a 3D scaffold that provides cohesiveness, mechanical 
stability and protection against host effectors and antimicrobial therapies. In addition, the 
EPS matrix can dynamically modulate chemical and nutrient gradients, and delineate 
pathogenic environments (such as acidic pH and hypoxia), which contribute to key virulence 
attributes, including recalcitrance1,4. Thus, targeting the EPS may be an effective strategy to 
remove biofilm, disaggregate bacteria and disrupt the pathogenic environment20. Targeting 
can be achieved by: inhibiting EPS production, binding EPS adhesins on the microbial 
surfaces to block adhesion, or by degrading EPS in established biofilms (Fig 2).

Disrupting EPS synthesis and secretion, and binding of EPS adhesins

Several extracellular and intracellular signalling networks as well as non-signalling 
mechanisms that promote the production of EPS have been identified. In general, cyclic-di-
GMP and cyclic-di-AMP21 control various EPS-producing exoenzymes, polysaccharides

and adhesins that are potential candidates that can be targeted to inhibit or disrupt EPS22,23. 
These nucleotide-signalling molecules regulate glucan-producing exoenzymes (for example, 
glucosyltransferase) in Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans as well as the aggregative 
exopolysaccharides Psl and Pel in Gram-negative P. aeruginosa. Several potential small 
inhibitors of di-guanylate or di-adenylyl cyclase have been identified through library 
screening or in silico drug discovery combined with bioactivity assessment using in vitro 
biofilm models,24,25 although their efficacy against biofilms awaits further in vivo 
validation.

The inhibition of EPS glucan synthesis by glucosyltransferase using small-molecule 
inhibitors reduced the accumulation of pathogenic biofilms on teeth, and supressed the onset 
of oral diseases in vivo without disturbing the resident microbiota.26,27 These small-
molecule inhibitors alone are not superior than current chemical modalities for oral biofilm 
control (chlorhexidine) or tooth decay prevention (fluoride), however, when used in 
combination, EPS inhibitors can greatly enhance their therapeutic effects26. Inhibitors of 
adhesin production and adhesin-binding antibodies or peptides have also been developed to 
disrupt bacterial binding to host surfaces. Small molecules (for example, peptides or 
mannosides) that target host- EPS matrix interactions have shown efficacy in prevention and 
treatment of both bacterial and fungal biofilm infections in vivo.28,29 Mannosides that target 
the bacterial adhesin FimH (alone or combined with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) 
prevented catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) in mice by reducing Escherichia 
coli colonization 2-log, and treated chronic cystitis by reducing the E. coli population 3-
log28,30,31. A recent study has also attempted to address the low half-life and bioavailability 
of O-mannosides by generating C-mannosides, which have increased metabolic stability and 
in vivo efficacy. Prophylactic treatment with this compound reduced the E. coli burden 2-log 
and treatment of chronic infection resulted in a 4-log reduction in a UTI mouse model32. 
Similarly, ring-fused 2-pyridones, which inhibit the biogenesis of curli and type-I pili, 
reduced uropathogenic E. coli bladder colonisation more than 10-fold and the establishment 
of intracellular bacterial communities in an in vivo mouse UTI model33. Several other 
biomolecules that bind to EPS adhesins are discussed in detail elsewhere34.

Targeting EPS chemical composition and structure

Exopolysaccharide-degrading enzymes such as glucanohydrolases (dextranase and 
mutanase) and dispersin B can disrupt the matrix of pathogenic oral biofilms, and glycoside 
hydrolases have been used to degrade a mixed-species S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilm 
grown in a mouse model of chronic wounds 35–37, although poor retention and enzymatic 
stability (for example, susceptibility to proteolysis) may compromise efficacy in vivo36. 
Nevertheless, a purified serine protease, Esp, from S. epidermidis inhibited S. aureus biofilm 
formation and eradicated pre-existing biofilms in vitro, while the susceptibility to the 
antimicrobial β-defensin 2 was enhanced and S. aureus nasal colonization in humans was 
reduced38. Another approach used endolysins (bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan 
hydrolases), which enzymatically degraded the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan 39. 
Engineered peptidoglycan hydrolase constructs with distinct antimicrobial activities 
degraded multiple unique bonds in the peptidoglycan structure specific to S. aureus40, and 
increased killing and biofilm removal in animal models. Fusion proteins derived from

multiple bacteriophage-encoded endolysins, each with unique actions, all added 
simultaneously may also reduce the risk of resistance, yet show sufficient specificity to avoid 
targeting commensal strains. Glycoside hydrolases were recently shown to both disrupt pre-
existing P. aeruginosa biofilms and potentiate neutrophil mediated killing41.

DNases have also shown efficacy in disrupting biofilms42. Consistent with the role of eDNA 
in the EPS matrix and in early biofilm development, DNase I is effective in disrupting early 
biofilms in vitro and in vivo42,43. Notably, other biomolecules, including polysaccharides 
and various proteins that are associated with eDNA contribute to biofilm structural integrity, 
which may explain the efficacy of DNase I in treating nascent biofilms. Few studies have 
used DNases to specifically target biofilms in vivo, however, it was shown to statistically 
significantly decrease Gardnerella vaginalis colonization on vaginal mucosal epithelial cells 
in a mouse model44. Therapeutic use of recombinant human DNase I (dornase alfa) degrades 
neutrophil and microorganism-derived DNA in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis, 
thus reducing sputum viscosity45. An intervention study with dornase alfa in patients with 
cystic fibrosis and early lung disease showed significantly improved lung function and lower 
risk of exacerbation compared to placebo groups, with a potential decrease in the rate of 
lung function decline in children46. A clinical trial investigating the efficacy of dornase alfa 
for the treatment of chronic otitis media, at the time of tympanostomy tube insertion to 
promote bacterial clearance from the middle ear combined with antibiotic drops, is under 
evaluation47,48.

Matrix-degrading enzymes can help disperse bacteria in biofilms for more effective killing 
when combined with antimicrobial agents. Targeting EPS can also disrupt the viscoelastic 
properties to further weaken biofilm cohesiveness and enhance antimicrobial efficacy, 
including host mediated antimicrobial responses. Recent studies showed that glucano-
hydrolases, glycoside-hydrolases and DNases enhanced antimicrobial delivery and 
potentiated killing by antibiotics or antimicrobial peptides when used in combination against 
pre-formed biofilms in vitro49,50. Overall, EPS synthesis inhibitors or EPS-degrading 
enzymes, which lack intrinsic antibacterial activity, seem to be a promising adjunctive 
approach for biofilm control that could potentially enhance the killing efficacy of 
antimicrobial agents and promote biofilm removal when co-administered.

EPS-targeted antibodies and nucleic acid-binding proteins

Vaccine approaches pose several challenges as a strategy to target biofilms , as vaccines are 
specific to a microorganism and clinical isolates from biofilm infections show considerable 
variability in genotype and/or the phenotypic expression of vaccine-targeted epitopes51. A 
more effective approach may be to use antibodies targeted specific EPS components. 
Monoclonal antibodies against P. aeruginosa-derived EPS identified epitopes that bound to 
the polysaccharide Psl, which is widely present in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates52. Psl was 
shown to be a serotype-independent, antibody-accessible antigen, and anti-Psl antibodies 
increased opsonophagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa, inhibited attachment to lung epithelial 
cells in vitro, and showed prophylactic protection in multiple animal models of P. aeruginosa 
infection. Additionally, vaccine-elicited antibodies to Enterococcus faecalis pilus tip (EbpA) 
abrogated bacterial binding to fibrinogen and biofilm formation in a mouse model of

catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)53. Notably, EbpA did not mediate E. 
faecalis adhesion directly to the catheter material, but rather inhibited binding to fibrinogen 
deposited on the catheter surface. The EbpA antibody response prevented EbpA-mediated 
fibrinogen-dependent bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation on catheters. This 
approach highlights why using a complex host-microorganism model can reveal additional 
targets. In another approach, a multivalent vaccine exploiting both planktonic and biofilm-
expressed polypeptides from S. aureus showed increased efficacy in combination with 
antibiotics compared to antibiotic treatment alone in a rabbit model of osteomyelitis54.

Nonetheless, targeting broadly conserved components in EPS is desirable. The DNABII 
family of DNA-binding proteins have a key role in providing structural integrity to eDNA55. 
The high binding affinity of integration host factor (IHF) has specifically been exploited to 
target nucleoproteins in biofilms and been widely tested in animal models. Antibodies 
against E. coli IHF are cross-reactive and bind to DNABII in multiple bacterial species, 
resulting in biofilm destabilisation and the release of individual bacteria. When combined 
with antibiotic therapy, immunotherapy targeting DNABII has shown efficacy in vivo 
against biofilms in numerous types of bacteria, including oral bacteria56, uropathogenic E. 
coli57 and P. aeruginosa in a mouse lung infection model58. This approach has also shown 
efficacy against MRSA biofilms compared with antibiotic treatment alone in mouse 
models59,60. In a combinatorial approach without using antibiotics, DNABII antibodies were 
combined with a vaccine strategy. A study with nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in an 
animal model of otitis media used IHF and recombinant soluble type IV pili (rsPilA) co-
administered with an adjuvant and delivered by transcutaneous immunization to achieve 
early NTHi eradication and prevention of disease 61. This approach also resulted in the 
disassembly of NTHi biofilms that were established prior to immunization, thus leading to 
resolution of existing disease.

Inducing biofilm dispersal

Biofilm dispersal has been shown to be a regulated process that involves the degradation of 
the EPS matrix, and the triggering of this response has provided research strategies designed 
to promote biofilm self-disassembly. These approaches, for the most part, assume that 
dispersed bacteria have returned to an active state akin to their planktonic phenotype, 
rendering them more susceptible to conventional antibiotics. Furthermore, liberated inactive 
cells will also have lost a degree of protection conferred by their association with the biofilm 
community and structural organization. Regardless of their dispersed state, it remains vitally 
important in the clinical setting that dispersive or exogenous EPS-degrading agents are 
administered alongside systemic antibiotics to avoid recolonization or bacteremia, and 
potentially septicaemia.

Targeting cyclic-di-GMP pathway

The intracellular secondary messenger nucleotide c-di-GMP has a key role in the biofilm 
lifecycle of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereby increased levels 
promote biofilm formation and reduced levels disassembly62. The enzymes governing c-di-
GMP levels, diguanylate cyclases (synthesis) and phosphodiesterases (breakdown), possess

GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP domains that are found in numerous bacterial phyla. This 
signalling pathway therefore offers an attractive strategy to target multiple species, although 
the complexity of c-di-GMP regulation makes it challenging to control63. However, few 
studies that show biofilm dispersal have used relevant cell models in vitro or in vivo animal 
models. One study used a P. aeruginosa construct containing an exogenous E. coli 
phosphodiesterase. When expression was induced in vivo it resulted in reduced c-di-GMP 
and dispersal of biofilms on silicone implants in a mouse foreign body infection model64. 
Although, in principle, this study supports the potential use of such phosphodiesterases as a 
strategy to modulate c-di-GMP and target biofilms, the authors noted limitations of their 
findings, including an increased bacterial burden in the spleen. C-di-GMP is also a potent 
stimulator of host immunity via interferon responses, and therefore it may be difficult to 
attribute effects on biofilms specifically in vivo65.

A well-characterized approach to modulate c-di-GMP levels is though nitric oxide (NO). 
NO was first shown to regulate c-di-GMP levels and mediate biofilm dispersal in 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa66 at low concentrations, and these results have since been 
reproduced in several other bacterial species67. However, the use of gaseous NO or 
spontaneous NO-donors presents clinical challenges owing to potential cytotoxicity from 
systemic exposure, lack of specificity in targeting biofilm infections and cost. In addition, as 
NO is labile, the optimal concentration to disperse biofilms is difficult to measure;. however 
NO microelectrodes are highly sensitive and offer excellent spatial and temporal resolution 
in tissues or body fluids. A proof-of-concept preclinical study using low-dose gaseous NO in 
the pM to nM range, has recently shown to reduce the size of the P. aeruginosa biofilm 
aggregate in sputum as a primary clinical outcome in a small number of patients with cystic 
fibrosis68. Patients did not exhibit adverse effects to NO therapy. Although the biofilm 
aggregate size was significantly decreased, NO did not reduce CFU as seen in another 
study69, perhaps because patients continued to receive antibiotic therapy throughout the 
study period. However a Phase I clinical trial is ongoing to study the efficacy and safety of 
NO in patients with cystic fibrosis70.

To address the cost of administering gaseous NO and potential systemic cytotoxicity issues, 
cephalosporin-3´-diazeniumdiolates (C3Ds), composed of a stabilized diazeniumdiolate NO-
donor attached to the 3’-position of cephalosporin, have recently been developed to 
selectively deliver NO to bacterial biofilms71. These pro-drug candidates are designed to 
specifically release NO upon cleavage of the cephalosporin β-lactam ring via bacterial β-
lactamases and have been shown to be effective in dispersing in vitro P. aeruginosa 
biofilms71. NTHi biofilms grown on primary ciliated epithelia also showed enhanced 
sensitivity to the antibiotic azithromycin, reducing viability 2-log when a specific C3D, 
PYRRO-C3D, was used as an adjuvant; this response is possibly attributable to dispersal and 
modulation of metabolic activity72. This effect was also demonstrated in a study using 
primary epithelial cells from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease that 
compromises mucociliary clearance. Airway cells from patients with PCD showed increased 
susceptibility to NTHi biofilm formation compared to epithelial cells from healthy 
individuals, and PYRRO-C3D in combination with antibiotic significantly decreased NTHi 
viability 2-log compared to antibiotic treatment alone73. Treatment of infected healthy 
airway cells and infected airway cells from unhealthy individuals had no effect on

transepithelial electrical resistance, which suggests that epithelial barrier function was 
unaffected. Although this alone is not a sufficient assessment of toxicity, the targeted release 
of low NO concentrations (48 – 90 nM) should improve the safety of patients.

NO-donor instability is also an issue that is being addressed by developing nitroxides 
(sterically hindered NO analogues) that exert biological responses via NO-mimetic 
properties74. These molecules (carboxy-TEMPO, CTMIO, DCTEIO) elicited biofilm 
dispersal in P. aeruginosa and E. coli similar to NO, with carboxy-TEMPO also reducing 
tolerance to ciprofloxacin74,75. However, treatment with carboxy-TEMPO failed to disperse 
MRSA biofilms, which indicates that this approach may be restricted to biofilms formed by 
certain species. This highlights an ongoing concern for polymicrobial biofilms infections. 
Other drugs that are currently under development include ciprofloxacin-nitroxide 
conjugates, which similar to C3Ds, combine antibiotic activity with a donor compound76, 
and fimbrolide-NO donor hybrids, which simultaneously target quorum sensing (QS) and 
NO pathways77.

Targeting quorum sensing

The role of QS systems in biofilm development and dispersal offers another intensely 
studied strategy for the development of novel therapeutics. QS requires the binding of a 
signalling molecule to a corresponding transcriptional regulator, which activates the 
downstream transcription of select targets. As the production of many virulence 
determinants in pathogenic bacteria requires cell-cell communication, QS inhibitors (QSI) 
that target the AHL-QS system in Gram-negative bacteria or the QS systems in Gram-
positive bacteria have been extensively evaluated for efficacy on clinically relevant bacterial 
biofilms using in vitro and in vivo models. For example, the QS autoinducer, AI-2, functions 
as a chemorepellent in Helicobacter pylori by regulating the proportion and spatial 
organisation of biofilm cells78. Treatment of in vitro biofilms with exogenous AI-2 resulted 
in both a reduction in the proportion of adherent cells and dispersal78. The autoinducing 
peptide type I (AIP-I) also triggered dispersal in MRSA biofilms on titanium disks rendering 
detached MRSA more susceptible to treatment with rifampicin and levofloxacin79. 
Additionally, the use of a RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) resulted in a 7-log reduction in 
MRSA compared to 5-log reductions observed with RIP-soaked Allevyn or teicoplanin 
treatments alone in a mouse wound model80. A recent study used a high-throughput screen 
to identify a benzamide-benzimidazole derivative, termed M64, that interferes with the 
Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) quorum sensing system, which regulates biofilm 
formation and the production of virulence factors in P. aeruginosa81. Interestingly, M64 
reduced both the virulence and persistence of the P. aeruginosa strain PA14 in a mouse 
model of burn and lung infections when used alone, and it reduced the bacterial load further 
when used in combination with ciprofloxacin. M64 also did not exhibit cytotoxicity in 
mouse macrophages and was shown to reduce the number of persister cells in the 
population.

Although the increased efficacy of antibiotic treatment with QSI in vivo is promising, 
reduced bacterial loads often depend on the strain and biofilm model82. Furthermore, QS 
molecules can be washed away during biofilm initiation, whereas the EPS matrix can bind

and sequester QS molecules and the effects may be limited to highly localized areas within 
the biofilm structure1. Therefore, inhibitors need access and specific targeting to site of 
active QS-signalling. These factors in addition to the complexity in cell signalling networks, 
make it a challenging therapeutic approach albeit such inhibitors can be used in combination 
with other strategies.

Metabolic interference

The potential of exogenous amino acids in the treatment of biofilms has garnered 
considerable interest, with specific amino acids having been shown to affect both biofilm 
metabolism and development. L-arginine (L-Arg) functions as a substrate for alkali 
production by arginolytic bacteria (for example, Streptococcus gordonii), which can 
neutralize acids and modulate pH homeostasis within oral biofilms clinically83. Treatment of 
polymicrobial biofilms comprising Streptococcus mutans, S. gordonii and Actinomyces 
naeslundii with L-Arg suppressed S. mutans growth and resulted in substantial reduction in 
insoluble EPS and altered biofilm architecture84. In addition to pH modulatory effects83, L-
Arg also repressed genes involved in the production of insoluble EPS and bacteriocin in S. 
mutans, while increasing hydrogen peroxide (used against S. mutans) production by S. 
gordonii84 L-Arg reduced biomass and altered EPS architecture in S. gordonii biofilms85, 
and also destabilized multispecies oral biofilms, thus reducing viability and increasing 
susceptibility to cetylpyridinium chloride86. An alternative amino acid, L-methionine, was 
also identified as a promising adjuvant for treating P. aeruginosa biofilms, triggering 
disassembly and increasing sensitivity towards ciprofloxacin in a mouse model of chronic 
pneumonia, and enhancing survival of infected mice87. This activity was attributed to up-
regulation of four different DNase genes and the subsequent degradation of eDNA in the 
EPS matrix, although the exact pathways that regulate this response were not determined. 
Interestingly, L-Met seems to have been chosen for this study following screening of a 
selection of D- amino acids and L- amino acids for their activity against P. aeruginosa 
biofilms. Given the diversity in amino acid utilization between bacterial species it is unlikely 
that a single amino acid would have a universal function, however, their importance, and that 
of bacterial metabolism in general, should not be underestimated in the development of 
future treatment strategies.

Another approach is based on evidence that iron metabolism is important in biofilm 
formation in several pathogens88–91. Iron acquisition is crucial for pathogens to establish 
infection, and epithelial cells containing the ΔF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation showed that increased biofilm formation by 
P.aeruginosa was linked to increased availability of iron92. Host defences normally actively 
sequester iron to limit the growth of infecting bacteria since iron is an essential nutrient. 
However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses multiple redundant iron receptor and uptake 
systems such as production of the siderophore pyoverdin (an iron-chelating 
molecule).However gallium, which is chemically similarto iron , is be taken up by bacteria 
but not replace its functionality, thus inhibiting the iron-dependent pathways required for 
cell growth and biofilm formation. This “Trojan horse” strategy interfered with P. aeruginosa 
growth and iron metabolism, killed planktonic bacteria in an acute mouse pneumonia model 
and reduced bacterial counts in established biofilms by 3 logs in a chronic biofilm lung

infection model93. Gallium was administered via inhalation and importantly uptake was 
independent of the P. aeruginosa siderophore pyoverdin in vitro. However in vivo it was not 
clear if gallium may have anti-inflammatory effects other than directly inhibiting biofilm 
formation. Nonetheless, using iron chelators adjunctively with tobramycin reduced P. 
aeruginosa in a co-culture model of human bronchial epithelial cells from a patient with 
cystic fibrosis that carried the CFTR ΔF508 mutation, resulted in a 7-log reduction in viable 
bacteria and also prevented biofilm formation on these cells94. More recently, the oxidation 
state of iron was shown to be important95. This study examined mucus from the airways of 
patients with cystic fibrosis and found that ferrous iron was the primary form of bioavailable 
iron, which also correlated with the severity of cystic fibrosis lung disease, whereas ferric 
iron did not. This study highlights the importance of directly investigating the phenotypic 
state of bacteria in situ in human infections and its potential translational relevance in 
informing new therapeutic approaches.

Targeting dormant cells in biofilms

Targeting pathways to induce processes such as dispersal requires that cells are 
metabolically active. However, available evidence also shows that dormant cells or persisters 
residing within biofilms have a key role for drug tolerance (Box 3). It is therefore attractive 
to consider antimicrobial approaches that physically or chemically disrupt cells rather than 
interfering with cellular processes. Non-discriminating oxidizing agents such as 
hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide have been used as irrigants in wound96 and endodontic 
debridement97. However studies reveal that even strong oxidizers such as sodium 
hypochlorite fail to eradicate biofilms98 probably because long-term exposure is not possible 
due to cytotoxicity concerns. Broad-spectrum cationic biguanides such as chlorhexidine or 
quaternary ammonium adhere to cell walls and disrupts cell membranes. However, 
penetration was limited over the expected timescales used in ex-vivo dental biofilms99 with 
longer term exposure increasing cytotoxicity, thus making this approach clinically 
impractical.

Other exploratory avenues include antibiotics that are used for the treatment of infections 
caused by slow-growing bacteria. Rifampin, used to treat staphylococcal orthopaedic-
implant infections, raises concern about the development of rifampin resistance. However, 
used in combination with other antibiotics, rifampin and fosfomycin enhanced efficacy in 
treating foreign body MRSA biofilm infections in vivo100. Likewise, disrupting a cellular 
target in dormant cells can kill persisters. The acyldepsipeptide antibiotic (ADEP4) can 
activate the ClpP protease in dormant persister cells in Gram-positive bacteria so the cells 
effectively ‘digest’ themselves. Although it is an elegant concept to endogenously activating 
cytoplasmic enzymes for proteolytic degradation in biofilms, it should be noted that ClpP is 
not an essential enzyme and ClpP-null mutants are not affected by ADEP4. To address this, 
treatment with both ADEP4 and rifampin showed good efficacy in a chronic biofilm mouse 
deep abscess-like infection model101 using various S. aureus species. However, this study 
illustrates that careful consideration needs to be given to antibiotic pairings. Particularly in 
this case since rifampin resistance occurs at high frequency and so it is usually combined 
with other active antimicrobials. In the case of ClpP-null mutants ADEP4 would be 
ineffective and rifampin would in effect be acting as a monotherapy

Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) represent another approach in treating biofilms independent 
of the presence of microbial activity. An important advantage of AMPs is that they are 
widely conserved and therefore attractive as broad-acting antimicrobial agents that may be 
useful against both bacterial and fungal biofilms102,103. Conversely, species-specific 
targeting is also possible with synthetic AMPs that consist of dual functionally independent 
moieties (a broad-spectrum AMP with a killing moiety, and a species-specific binding 
peptide with target specificity). This approach may remove specific pathogens such as S. 
mutans from oral multispecies biofilm communities to promote a ‘healthy-like microbiome’ 
as was shown in vitro104. Another advantage is that the pore-forming activity of an AMP 
targets respiring cells as well as persister and dormant populations, which might reduce the 
potential for bacteria to develop AMP resistance. Therefore, AMPs have potential as 
therapeutics to target biofilms. Synthetic peptides that modify specific AMP sequences were 
designed that showed both inhibitory activity and, when used together with antibiotics, 
enhanced killing of P. aeruginosa biofilms in invertebrate infection models105. Specific 
peptides also triggered the degradation of ppGpp, preventing the accumulation of this 
secondary messenger and abrogating biofilm formation of several G-positive and G-negative 
pathogens103. However, more pre-clinical efficacy studies are required as AMPs can bind to 
EPS matrix components and to other host molecules, which reduces their effectiveness, and 
microbial proteases may further diminish AMP potency106. Additionally, the high cost of 
AMPs synthesis is a barrier for clinical development and commercialization, although using 
chloroplast-based technology for large-scale production in automated greenhouses may 
mitigate costs50. Nevertheless, AMPs can be immobilized onto solid surfaces to enhance 
efficacy or specificity. This was particularly effective as a polymer-based approach on 
catheters, as AMP coatings greatly reduced P. aeruginosa adhesion and infection over 7 days 
in a mouse UTI model107. Furthermore, structurally nanoengineered AMP polymers 
exhibited potent killing activity against several Gram-negative, colistin-resistant and MDR 
pathogens, and they exhibited low toxicity and efficacy in an animal model of Acinetobacter 
baumannii infection108. The recent completion of two Phase II clinical studies of brilacidin 
(a membrane-acting AMP mimetic) as an intravenous agent for skin infections demonstrate 
the feasibility of AMPs for systemic therapeutics109.

AMPs can also enhance conventional antimicrobial activity, and the combination with 
strategies that target the EPS matrix may further increase both the access and permeabilizing 
properties of AMPs once in the biofilm50,103. Although targeting tolerant cells using AMPs 
is a promising approach, reaching the target cells that are embedded within a biofilm either 
topically or systemically and for the compound to be active across a spatially and chemically 
heterogeneous microenvironment remain important challenges in vivo. The stability and 
durability of AMP coatings within the body is also an issue that needs to be further 
addressed, particularly where wear might be expected due to shear caused by moving tissues 
and fluids as well as proteolytic degradation.

The promise of new technologies

While our understanding of biofilm microenvironments is evolving, technological advances 
have provided unprecedented avenues to develop multi-targeted therapeutic approaches that 
prevent and disrupt biofilms or enhance drug efficacy (Fig. 3). Nano- and chemical

engineering approaches provide unparalleled flexibility to control the composition, size, 
shape, surface area and surface chemistry, and functionality of nanostructures that can be 
used to develop a new generation of modified materials or to coat existing solid surfaces for 
biofilm prevention. Functionalized nanoparticles, including stimuli-triggered activation, can 
be designed to enhance penetration and selectively target or release drugs locally after 
bacterial attachment or within biofilms. In this Review we focus on overall concepts and 
provide insights into their clinical potential based on recent studies using in vivo models. We 
have provided a full list of current and prospective technologies and additional references in 
Supplemental Table S1.

Surface modifications

Surface-tethering or the incorporation of an antibiotic or biocide within a “reservoir” coating 
has long been studied as a possible approach to inhibit bacterial adhesion and biofilm 
formation110. However, sustaining efficacy and therefore justifying their progression to wide 
scale use into the clinic has been challenging. The amount of biocide required to achieve 
efficacy as well as its chemical composition are often limited by potential deleterious effects, 
exemplified by silver nanoparticles which were shown to be toxic to rat hosts111. 
Additionally, antimicrobial reservoir coatings are subject to progressive decreases in efficacy 
as the active agent is depleted and thus have a limited lifetime of activity. Further, 
nonspecific absorption of exogenous surfactants and proteins may mask the engineered 
surface or hinder release.

Advances in material and surface engineering have led to the development of well-defined 
topographic surface patterns that can control biofilm formation without including 
antimicrobial agents112. The most well-established ordered topography is the Sharklet™ 
surface. Inspired by shark skin and its inherent anti-biofouling properties, microscale ribs of 
various lengths are combined into a repeating diamond micropattern, creating a textured 
surface that prevents macro and micro biofouling113 as well as bacterial colonisation and 
biofilm formation when incorporated into the surfaces of medical devices114. Surface 
modifications are mostly focused on nonspecific protein repulsion and the inhibition of 
bacterial colonization. This can be challenging due to the structural and physio-chemical 
diversity of the numerous proteins in biological fluids surrounding a surface in a biomedical 
setting 115. Hydrophilic polymer brushes or tethered polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) 
(PEG) are widely used in the prevention of medical device fouling116. While early bacterial 
adhesion is attenuated, probably due to the inhibition of an initial protein priming layer, the 
multifaceted nature of bacterial colonization (often involving non-proteinaceous adhesins) 
can lead to eventual biofilm formation117. Further studies with ‘super-hydrophilic’ (super-
wet) or ‘super-hydrophobic’ surfaces have decreased protein deposition and bacterial 
attachment of clinically relevant surfaces115,118.

The incorporation of these materials into medical devices shows promising, but variable 
results. While recently greater sustainability of super-hydrophobic surfaces upon mechanical 
abrasion has been demonstrated119, the antibiofilm effects of these surfaces are often 
transient or subject to species bias120. Short to medium-term biofilm suppression may be

sufficient however to permit effective immune and prophylactic responses and tissue 
integration of a foreign body.

The development of functionalized medical implant surfaces with a vast array of 
antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties has been intensely studied, particularly with respect 
to titanium implants. To use these surfaces in biomedical applications, modern surface 
design has been largely driven by top-down methods such as lithography, imprinting and 
others121 to produce a vast array of antibacterial coatings, including but not limited to, silver, 
copper, titanium dioxide and chitosan. Furthermore, emerging bottom-up approaches using 
nanomaterials as ‘building blocks’122 and surface attachment and immobilization of 
biomolecules, including antimicrobial peptides or proteins and polysaccharides123,124, have 
also resulted in the development of antibacterial surface coatings. Moreover, the unexpected 
discovery that certain bacterial polysaccharides can inhibit biofilm formation124, has led to 
the development of strategies to counter biofilm formation‥ Hyaluronic acid (which is one 
of the most studied polysaccharides) reduced the adhesion of S. aureus to hyaluronic acid-
coated titanium surfaces125 and poly(methyl methacrylate) intraocular lenses126.

Bottom-up surface-assemblies can also be combined with top-down surface processing127 to 
generate nanocoatings with biofilm-targeting properties and biocompatibility128. Recent in 
vivo studies demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of tunable multi-layer nanocoatings 
that released different combinations of antibiotics129 or sequential delivery of gentamicin 
and an osteoinductive growth factor130 in a time-staggered manner for prevention of biofilm-
associated infection and bone tissue repair around implants. Both studies demonstrated the 
ability to prevent biofilm formation on the device surface, relative to uncoated controls, with 
the nanocoatings able to clear infiltrating bacteria and prevented colonization of the implant 
while promoting bone formation and osseointegration. Importantly, biocompatibility, as well 
as long-term host retention and release kinetics were also demonstrated, thus providing 
promise for their more wide-spread application in orthopaedics.

Efforts to engineer surfaces with even more control over the specificity and sensitivity of 
their antibacterial or antibiofilm capabilities have led to so-called smart surfaces, which are 
also known as stimuli-responsive or triggered biofilm-targeting surfaces. Triggers, including 
pH, temperature, salt concentration, metabolites, electrical currents and photoactivation, 
induce topographical and chemical changes in the surface area as well as generating heat or 
induce drug release to kill or repel bacterial attachment (Supplemental Table S1). The design 
principles for controlling bacterial adhesion or biofilm removal mechanisms that may be 
triggered on demand are intriguing. However, the effectiveness of these approaches has been 
evaluated largely in vitro. Consequently, as with all surface modifications, whether 
functionality will remain in vivo upon binding of endogenous host proteins in saliva, blood, 
synovial fluid and urine is unclear. Another consideration is that bacteria that associate with 
the surface may be killed and remain attached, thus masking the underlying technology and 
even provide a nutrient source for other bacteria. Therefore, it is important to not only have a 
killing effect but also a ‘self-cleaning’ mechanism, possibly facilitated by mechanical shear 
of surrounding body fluids or tissues. Furthermore, challenges to enhance mechanochemical 
stability and overcome coating deterioration and dissolution, and non-adverse host reactions

to the coating itself will need to be addressed in future studies to facilitate clinical 
application131–133.

Nanoparticles

Nanoparticles are versatile and bioactive and they are becoming increasingly popular as an 
biofilm-targeting approach. Nanoparticles with intrinsic antimicrobial activity, primarily 
inorganic materials such as silver, can act as biofilm-targeting agents or as nanocoatings (as 
described above). Due to their flexible chemical structures, they can also function as drug 
delivery vehicles (nanocarriers) with organic nanoparticles accounting for over two-thirds of 
the systems approved for use in humans134. Furthermore, both inorganic and organic 
nanoparticles can be combined or modified by adding molecules (hybrid nanoparticles) to 
enhance their biological properties or provide multifunctionality. As excellent in-depth 
reviews on the principles and current applications of nanoparticles, particularly silver, are 
available13,135, we focus on clinically used liposomal nanoparticles for drug delivery and 
emerging technologies, including stimuli-triggered activation, that have shown efficacy in 
vivo.

Liposomes are physiologically compatible vesicles that are composed of one or more 
phospholipid bilayers, and they represent one of the most widely developed organic 
nanoparticles for drug delivery . They are able to penetrate the biofilm well, are 
biocompatible and show efficacy against biofilms of a wide variety of bacterial species for a 
diverse number of antibiotics136,137. These nanocarriers can protect the antimicrobial agent 
from deleterious interactions with the matrix, or enzymatic inactivation and degradation at 
the infection site by other bacterial and host components. The lipid structure can also fuse 
with the bacterial outer membrane releasing the drug directly into the cell, thereby 
potentially maximizing therapeutic effects while reducing host cytotoxicity137. Furthermore, 
liposomes can carry more than one drug by co-encapsulation and can be also functionalized 
by linking biomolecules (for example, peptides, pH-responsive polymers) on the 
nanoparticle surface to increase targeting specificity and triggered release. Importantly, 
however, some studies have reported a reduced efficacy of liposomal-encapsulated 
antimicrobials dependent on the environment in which the biofilm resides; for example: 
host- and microorganism-derived substances such as mucus and alginate could inhibit 
bacteria-liposome interactions138. Nevertheless, several formulations are currently in 
preclinical studies and clinical trials, and some are commercially available 139. For example, 
liposomal ciprofloxacin and amikacin have shown promise in the management of chronic 
lung infection in cystic fibrosis140,141. The potential of liposomes to function as delivery 
agents for other antimicrobials, such as NO, has demonstrated significantly reduced S. 
aureus biofilm mass compared to controls in a sheep model of chronic rhinosinusitis142. 
Whilst this study did not note any negative clinical symptoms, a transient increase in heart 
rate and decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in the animals which require 
further investigation before this strategy can advance into human trials.

Nanoparticles with multi-functionality or on-demand activation upon specific stimuli similar 
to smart surfaces represent the most widely developed class of nanoparticles currently under 
development (Supplemental Table S1). Recent studies with inorganic nanoparticles such as

iron oxide (Fe3O4) with a peroxidase-like function catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 
concentrations ranging from 0.1–1% H2O2 in a dose- and pH-dependent manner, and 
showed potent effects against virulent oral biofilms in vivo143. Under acidic (pathological) 
conditions, nanoparticles activated the generation of free radicals from H2O2 in situ, which 
induced the degradation of the biofilm matrix and rapid killing of the embedded bacteria 
(>5-log reduction of viable cells compared to control cells within 5 min, and 5000-fold more 
effective than 1% H2O2 alone)144. Daily topical treatments effectively reduced the onset and 
severity of dental caries (tooth decay), preventing cavitation altogether in a rodent model of 
the disease. The pH-dependent functionality prevents catalytic reaction at physiological pH 
and unmitigated free-radical production, thus improving biocompatibility.

Stimuli-triggered mechanisms by nanoparticles can also enhance the selectivity of drug 
activation or delivery to cells within a biofilm, protecting host tissues and the commensal 
microbiota while targeting infective agents within pathological microniches143,145,146. 
Delivery of the antibacterial agent farnesol via acidic pH-triggered polymeric nanoparticles 
enhanced its biofilm-targeting activity 4-fold (compared to farnesol alone); thus, the delivery 
system greatly improved the drug efficacy against an oral biofilm infection in vivo following 
topical treatment146. These water-soluble polymeric nanocarriers can encapsulate 
hydrophobic and apolar drugs into aqueous solution, which is a crucial issue in product 
development. Similarly, nanoparticles that are conjugated with a pH-responsive element145 
or pH-sensitive surface charge switching147 were developed to increase biofilm penetration 
and selective bacterial binding for targeted delivery and antibacterial activity in acidic 
conditions.

Another exciting area of development is in increasing the specificity of the nanoparticles by 
selectively targeting biofilm matrix constituents or through the introduction of bacteria-
specific ligands, to improve both efficacy and biocompatibility. Nanoparticles functionalized 
with biofilm EPS matrix-digesting enzymes (DNase) and loaded with ciprofloxacin 
eradicated established P. aeruginosa biofilms without cytotoxicity against macrophages49. 
Likewise, tobramycin alginate-chitosan nanoparticles functionalised by conjugation to 
dornase alfa (DNase) demonstrated better biofilm penetration and DNA degradation in 
sputum from patient with cystic fibrosis and increased protection against bacteria in an 
invertebrate infection model148. Furthermore, nanoparticles that were designed to release 
and activate NO in situ had antifungal and antibacterial effects, inhibited biofilm formation 
and promoted the degradation of the EPS matrix in vitro and in vivo149,150. Recently, reports 
showed that linking antimicrobial peptides102 or aptamers151 to nanoparticle surfaces 
enhanced their killing efficacy, specificity or functionality.

Overall, nanoparticles offer a promising therapeutic platform for the development of new 
effective biofilm-targeting approaches. However, whilst the development of novel 
nanoparticles has continued apace, there is a continually widening gap between the number 
of new formulations under laboratorial investigation and those in clinical use. Further 
advances in this field should focus on enhancing in vivo efficacy (compared to current 
treatment modalities) and biocompatibility, and on understanding the potential toxicity and 
the metabolism of nanoparticles in the body. Affordable large scale manufacturing would be 
also required for product development to the healthcare market. Nevertheless, the

availability of previously FDA-approved nanoparticles demonstrates their potential for more 
wide-spread future clinical use.

Future directions

The initiation of a biofilm involves complex and dynamic interactions among the surface, 
the microorganism and the EPS. Upon biofilm establishment, the adhesive strength and 
viscoelastic properties make the removal of a biofilm from surfaces difficult, and resident 
microorganisms become tolerant to antimicrobials. Although tolerance is a common feature 
of biofilms, the mechanisms underlying tolerance as a microbial survival strategy are 
multifaceted. Likewise a reciprocal multifaceted approach to control biofilms is far more 
likely to achieve clinical success than a futile search for a magic bullet (Box 2). 
Understanding the complexity of biofilm biology highlights the role of complementary 
strategies that target both the microorganisms and the surrounding EPS matrix to either 
prevent the initiation of a biofilm or to disrupt existing biofilms. The challenge of using 
antimicrobials alone, which may kill microorganisms, but leave behind biodegradable 
substrates for microbial reutilization, must be addressed. Thus, eliminating existing biofilms 
may require simultaneous degradation of the protective EPS matrix, and targeting and killing 
both resident microorganisms and dispersed cells. The complexity of polymicrobial 
interactions (synergistic, cooperative or antagonistic), spatial organization and community 
behaviour with host immunity factors further reinforces the need of a combinatorial therapy. 
Rapid advances in drug discovery methods should accelerate the identification of EPS-
inhibitors, inducers of biofilm dispersal and agents that target dormant cells, as well as 
combinations thereof with host immunomodulation therapies152,153. However, further 
validation of proof-of-concept studies using clinically relevant animal models as well as 
clinical trials are needed for rigorous evaluation. Bacterial co-cultures with primary human 
cells to evaluate host-microbial response can be valuable to investigate, for example, the role 
of genetic mutations such as found in patients with cystic fibrosis or PCD on the 
establishment and treatment of biofilms in patients suffering from these diseases. 
Opportunities to create physico-chemical and biological structures, including organ-on-chip, 
within microfluidic devices or using 3D printed tissues may also help assess treatment 
efficacy by mimicking in vivo-like environments.

Furthermore, new technologies , including ‘smart-release’ or ‘on-demand activation’ of 
bioactive agents when triggered by pathogenic microenvironments (e.g. acidic pH or 
hypoxia), have been developed for enhanced selectivity and controlled in situ drug delivery. 
However, the vast majority of the studies were conducted in vitro using non-clinically 
relevant models or treatment regimens, with many failing to progress to in vivo studies and 
even fewer to clinical application. The complexity of the host microbiota, where 
commensals co-exist with potential pathogens, provide a great challenge in developing 
antimicrobial agents against a particular microbial species. The presence of biological fluids 
that change surface chemistries poses yet another challenge. The ability of a drug to 
penetrate existing biofilms should be also considered, as this feature affects both potential 
cytotoxicity and antibacterial efficacy, and the potential for de novo emergence of 
antimicrobial resistance (owing to bacteria being subjected to sub-lethal antibiotic 
concentrations). Antibodies, aptamers or peptides that are linked to nanoparticles greatly

enhance specificity, although higher costs and additional chemistry to produce multi-
component structures may be limiting factors. A key approach may be to trigger 
antimicrobial activity in response to pathogenic microenvironments (for example, acidic pH, 
hypoxia or pathogen-derived metabolites). Thus, the biological effects can be tuned to 
specifically target the biofilm microenvironment, degrade the matrix and kill resident 
bacteria, thereby eradicating the pathogenic niche with precision and minimal cytotoxicity to 
surrounding tissues. Nevertheless, we noted a discrepancy between the research efforts on 
new technologies and commercialization. A concerted effort of chemists, engineers and 
biomedical researchers combined with toxicology and safety studies will help clinicians to 
assess the efficacy of these new technologies in clinical trials. However, the successful 
translation into the clinic is not just dependent on efficacy of the technology, but also on 
regulatory agencies and industry efforts to bring it to the market. Future directions should 
focus on achieving maximal efficacy and specificity with minimal toxicity and long-term 
therapeutic effects along with industry partnerships to develop low-cost and practical 
formulations for clinical use.

Glossary

Lock therapy
An approach whereby a high concentration of antibiotics are injected into the catheter lumen 
for an extended period to eradicate bacteria. Catheter locks have been used to treat sepsis 
since the 1980s; however with the understanding that infecting microorganisms are present 
as biofilms on medical device materials, this approach is now specifically tailored to 
improve efficacy

EPS
The EPS can contain exopolysaccharides, fibrous and globular proteins (including 
extracellular enzymes), lipids and nucleic acids (eDNA). Those components form a matrix 
that can be surface-associated or secreted locally or deposited on abiotic and biotic surfaces. 
The EPS-matrix acts as a ‘multifunctional scaffold’ that supports and protects embedded 
bacteria

Nitric oxide
Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous signalling molecule found in both prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic systems. NO is toxic in the mM range, but in the pM and nM range it can be used

to form oxidative and nitrosative reactive species that interact with proteins, DNA and 
metabolic enzymes. As NO is labile, the optimal concentration to disperse biofilms is 
difficult to measure; however NO microelectrodes are highly sensitive and offer excellent 
spatial and temporal resolution in tissues or body fluids

Antimicrobial peptides
A subset of host defence peptides with antibiotic activity. Peptides such as LL-37 
(cathelicidin) and human β-defensins are rapidly-acting, small-molecule effectors as part of 
the innate immune response of the host

Topographic surface patterns
Patterns include protruding squares, cone-shapes, wrinkle and ridge-like patterning or 
nanopores that disrupt bacterial adhesion

Super-hydrophobic surfaces
Surfaces that maintain air at the solid-liquid interface when hydrated. This leads to improved 
functionality via water repellency or reduced drag

Smart surfaces
Smart surfaces elicit their effect only upon contact with certain physiological or 
physiochemical cues to provide targeted application, thus increasing therapeutic precision 
and reducing the risk of cytotoxicity

Nanoparticles
Structures with a size range between 1–1000 nm. They can be classified as organic or 
inorganic and can exhibit antibacterial properties or can be used as drug delivery systems

Adhesins
Bacterial or fungal surface-associated determinants that mediate adherence to living cells or 
attachment to abiotic surfaces and can promote virulence

Antimicrobial chemotherapy
The clinical treatment of microbial infections with antimicrobial agents

Mannosides
A mannose glycoside consisting of a carbohydrate bound to the hydroxyl group of another 
compound by O-, N-, S- or C-glycosidic bonds, each with different susceptibilities to 
hydrolysis

Curli
A class of bacterial amyloid (aggregates of proteins that form insoluble fibres) produced by 
many Enterobacteriaceae and a major component of the extracellular matrix, promoting 
surface adhesion, cell aggregation, and biofilm formation

Type-I pili
Filamentous surface structures possessing a FimH adhesin at the pilus tip, mediating 
adherence to host cells and uropathogenic E. coli invasion of bladder epithelial cells

Text Box 1. Common features of microbial biofilms

Chemical composition, physical properties

Adherence. Microorganisms adhere to virtually all man-made materials (i.e. plastics, metals, ceramics and 
hybrids) and biotic surfaces (i.e. tooth enamel, bone, skin, airway, intestinal, and vaginal mucosa, connective 
tissue, vascular endothelium), using both specific (bacterial adhesin-host receptor interactions) and non-specific 
adhesion (hydrophobic or electrostatic forces) mechanisms154.

Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. Although the precise chemical and physical composition of 
the EPS (polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids) varies between species and growth conditions (i.e. nutrient 
type and abundance, hydrodynamics, temperature, oxygen concentration), the EPS provides a scaffold for 
mechanical stability, and creates compartmentalized chemical and physical microenvironments affording 
protection to the cells within a heterogeneous 3D structure.

Architecture. Although there is some variation in the structure of in vitro grown biofilms, there are a limited 
number of common forms (flat patches, mounds, mushrooms, towers, ripples, streamers) that are not generally 
species specific but largely dependent on biofilm maturity and the production of certain EPS components and 
growth conditions. Biofilms seen in many clinical specimens tend to consist of aggregates of cells of varying 
sizes and mixed-species in polymicrobial systems 155.

Viscoelasticity. A material property that allows biofilms to absorb and dissipate energy, rather than detach, 
when exposed to mechanical forces, such as hydrodynamic shear. The elastic component allows the biofilm to 
spring back into shape during intermittent perturbations, while the viscous component allows biofilms to flow 
like liquids when forces are sustained.5.

Heterogeneity. Biofilms are heterogeneous (non-uniform) in distribution, structure and physiology at various 
spatial scales. On the larger scale (mms to cms) they are generally not uniformly distributed on surfaces but 
occur in patches of cell-clusters (also called microcolonies or aggregates) in a range of sizes and shapes. Within 
the biofilm heterogeneous and compartmentalized microenvironments (10s to 100 µms) develop which 
modulate microbial activity, intercellular signalling and metabolic exchange locally, thus spatially organizing 
cellular and communal behaviour which is an important factor for enhanced tolerance and persistence.

Physiological and regulatory aspects

Developmental life cycle. Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a widely used model organism for studying microbial 
biofilms formation. Although many of the concepts identified in this organism, such as the mechanism of 
attachment, growth, maturation and dispersal, are widely conserved among other biofilm forming pathogens, 
there are fundamental differences. For example, many biofilm-forming species, such as staphylococci, unlike P. 
aeruginosa, are non-motile, many species have surface structures that are important for adhesion (capsule, pili 
or flagella) but many do not, and lastly not all species have known signalling systems.

Diffusible cell signals. These signals co-ordinate population behaviour156, metabolic activity, biofilm 
formation and dispersal. Families of homoserine lactones are produced by a number of Gram negative species 
while Gram positive organisms more commonly use autoinducing peptides (AIP).

Altered microenvironment formation. The development of gradients in nutrients, pH and oxygen as a 
consequence of metabolic activity of microorganisms that reside in a biofilm and diffusion limited mass 
transport of molecules into and out of the EPS matrix alter the microenvironment in the biofilm.

Dormant or slow growing sub-populations. Those include persisters and small colony variants (SCVs), 
which are tolerant to antibiotics. In addition, nutrient depletion in the interior of the biofilm can result in a 
stationary phase-like dormancy.

Text Box 2. Lessons learned from cancer

Over 100 years ago Paul Ehrlich, the German physician scientist used the term ‘magische 
kugel’ to describe an ideal hypothetical therapeutic agent that specifically targets and 
kills disease-causing cells157. In the context of cancer’ the target of such a magic bullet 
were the newly discovered receptors found on tumor cells. Another magic bullet was 
interferon, the cytokine that was discovered in 1957158. However, a magic bullet for 
cancer therapy remains elusive in part because over the last 40 years of intense molecular 
research, it has been shown that “cancer is not simply a single disease that affects many 
parts of the body”. Rather, it is many different diseases with common themes that can 
cause different kinds of disorders in many of our organs”159. In addition, individual 
tumors exhibit substantial chemical and clonal heterogeneity with distinct phenotypes 
which combined with the ability of cancer cells to rapidly adapt to chemotherapeutics 
and the microenvironment, challenge both broad spectrum and targeted therapies. In 
tumors, the structure and composition of the extracellular matrix is often altered, creating 
a favourable cellular niche for malignant transformation and cancer progression. Biofilms 
share similar common themes (Box 1), including the ability to create distinct 
microenvironments with unique chemical, physical, phylogenetic, genotypic and 
phenotypic heterogeneities. Early cancer therapy borrowed from approaches to treat acute 
bacterial and viral infections by targeting individual cells (with antibiotics and 
vaccination), with limited success. Our current understanding of biofilm biology is 
following a similar path to tumor biology. Rather than piled-up assemblages of clonal 
cells, microbial biofilms represents a dynamic self-constructed ecosystems within a 
matrix containing highly heterogeneous and compartmentalized milieu, and more 
effective biofilm therapies will likely need to target the complete microenvironment as 
well as the individual cells within144.

Text Box 3. Persistence, resistance and tolerance

The terms persistence, resistance and tolerance, are often used interchangeably when 
used to describe the inability of antibiotics (and antimicrobial agents) to inhibit or kill 
bacteria within a biofilm to the same extent as planktonic cultures 160. Resistance usually 
has an underlying heritable genetic basis that might be acquired through point mutation 
or horizontal gene transfer and is defined through standardized MIC and MBC assays. 
Tolerance is less-well defined and is arguably more appropriately used when antibiotic-
susceptible strains (by MIC and MBC) require much higher concentrations to obtain 
similar log-reductions when growing in the biofilm phenotype. Importantly, tolerance can 
be lost when biofilms are dispersed into single cells, thus dispersal strategies are 
normally considered as adjuvants for antimicrobial therapy. However, dispersed 
planktonic aggregates of cells may still retain tolerance. Persistence (and persistent 
biofilm) is a term that is loosely used to describe a clinically protracted unabated biofilm 
infection despite treatment. However, persistence in this sense should not be confused 
with ‘persisters’ 161 or sub-populations of cells with a distinct dormant phenotype 
affording them protection against antibiotics, which kill the metabolically active 
population. Persister cells can occur in both planktonic and biofilm cultures, but the 
stressful conditions, physical stability and protection from host phagocytes afforded by 
the biofilm microenvironment appear to contribute to harbouring microbial populations, 
which grow and repopulate once the antibiotic stress is removed. It is thought that these 
populations are tolerant of conventional antibiotics because there are no active cellular 
processes to interrupt. These subpopulations can form spontaneously or be induced from 
environmental stresses in the biofilm microenvironment162 (see Ref.161 for a Review).

Figure 1. Opportunities for therapeutic intervention during various stages of the biofilm life-
cycle
Biofilm formation proceeds as a developmental process with distinct stages: “initial 
adhesion” where microorganisms bind to host or medical device surfaces through cell 
surface associated adhesins; “early biofilm formation” where they begin to divide and 
produce EPS which enhances adhesion, while forming the matrix that embeds the cells; 
“biofilm maturation” where 3D structures develop in which the EPS matrix provides a multi-
functional and protective scaffold which allows heterogeneous chemical and physical 
microenvironments to form where microorganisms co-exist within polymicrobial and social 
interactions (competitive and synergistic); and finally “dispersal” where cells leave the

biofilm to re-enter the planktonic phase. Biofilms can be targeted at these various stages. a) 
The initial phase of biofilm formation can be disrupted, for example, by preventing the 
attachment of microorganisms by interrupting the interactions between the microorganism 
and the surface, by targeting cell surface associated adhesins (appendages, proteins and 
EPS). b) The inhibition of early stages of biofilm development includes targeting the 
production of EPS and cellular division. c) Disruption of formed biofilms could be achieved 
by physical removal, the degradation of the EPS-matrix, targeting the establishment of 
pathogenic microenvironments (low pH or hypoxia) and social interactions (in 
polymicrobial biofilms) as well as elimination of dormant cells. d) Finally, biofilm 
dispersion can be induced by EPS matrix remodelling or activation to dispersal mechanisms.

Figure 2. Targeting the EPS
Disruption of EPS components, and the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the 
production and secretion of EPS components, represent attractive targets for the 
development of biofilm-targeting strategies, some of which have potential efficacy across 
microbial species. One approach includes the degradation of the EPS. Treatments have been 
developed that directly target the eDNA (DNases), exopolysaccharides (dispersin B, 
glycoside hydrolases, monoclonal antibody vaccines), and protein (DNABII family 
antibodies) components of the matrix. EPS adhesin-binding antibodies or inhibitors and 
phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases have been developed to target bacterial adhesion

and biofilm initiation. Inhibitors of EPS synthesis and the secretion systems have also shown 
promise to disrupt biofilm accumulation. Endogenous pathways that induce biofilm dispersal 
can also be targeted, including the regulation of c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP levels using 
exogenous NO and inhibitors, or targeting quorum sensing using various inducing peptides 
and messenger molecules. Importantly, all of these treatment strategies, alone or in 
combination, can lead to inhibition of biofilm formation, disrupt biofilm integrity and/or 
promote the release of individual bacterial cells that are more susceptible to conventional 
antibiotic treatment enhancing clinical efficacy.

Figure 3. Technological approaches to combat biofilms
Recent advances in material science and nanotechnology enabled the engineering of a wide 
array of biofilm-targeting strategies. a) The material and surface properties of medical 
devices, such as surface charge, hydrophobicity, roughness, topography and chemistry 
among others, can be modified to prevent bacterial attachment and therefore attenuate or 
block biofilm formation. Additionally, ‘smart’ or stimuli-triggered responsive surfaces can 
be constructed that elicit their effect only in response to physical contact with cell-wall or 
membrane associated adhesins or chemical cues (i.e. secreted EPS, metabolites) of the 
bacteria. b) Advancement in nanoparticle synthesis has led to the development of diverse 
approaches to combat biofilms. Inorganic metallic (silver, copper etc.) and organic 
nanoparticles (liposomes, aptamers etc.), have been increasingly evaluated to improve their 
anti-biofilm efficacy, as well as their biocompatibility to reduce toxic effects on the host. 
Nanoparticles can be used to form nanocoatings, be incorporated into materials as 
composites or fillings or combined together with conventional antimicrobials and other 
approaches designed to physically disrupt or remove the biofilm. Furthermore, antimicrobial 
peptides (AMPs) and aptamers also display specific biofilm-targeting properties that can be 
also used to enhance specificity and efficacy of nanoparticles (hybrid nanoparticles). c) New 
technologies for physical biofilm removal, including mechanical, energy- and light-based 
disruption, may further improve biofilm intervention strategies. Given the multifaceted 
nature of biofilm formation and the complex microbial interactions with the surrounding 
physical and chemical environment, a combination of these approaches may be required to 
successfully combat biofilm-mediated disease.

Figure 4. Multi-targeting approach to combat biofilms
The physical and biological complexity of biofilms and tolerance to antimicrobials render 
them less susceptible to conventional therapeutic approaches. Biofilm targets include 
microbial cells (often polymicrobial communities) and the EPS matrix, and therapeutics can 
be delivered from the overlying surrounding biological fluid as well as the surfaces of the 
medical devices themselves. We envision exogenous approaches (such as adhesion-targeting 
materials and coatings, and adhesin-blocking agents) to complement or synergize with 
endogenous activation (such as immunity modulation) to prevent microbial attachment to 
host or abiotic surfaces in patients. Likewise, a combination of approaches that degrade the 
protective matrix, activate dispersal, and target the resident pathogens, persisters and 
dispersed cells without affecting commensals may be required to eliminate existing biofilms. 
Long-term effects of modified surfaces in the presence of biological fluids as well as 
enhanced drug penetration properties and a decrease in toxicity or allergic reactions are 
required for in vivo efficacy. These combined with clinically relevant treatment regimen 
(either topical or systemic) and long-term effect assessment should help successfully 
translate the hypothetical concepts into the clinic. The grey arrows indicate that biofilm 
bacteria and EPS can move or interact between the surface and fluid phases.
