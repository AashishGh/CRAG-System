Abstract

Biofilms are surface-associated bacterial communities that play both beneficial and harmful roles 
in nature, in medicine, and in industry. Tolerant and persister cells are thought to underlie biofilm-
related bacterial recurrence in medical and industrial contexts. Here, we review recent progress 
aimed at understanding the mechanical features that drive biofilm resilience and the biofilm 
formation process at single-cell resolution. We discuss findings regarding mechanisms underlying 
bacterial tolerance and persistence in biofilms and how these phenotypes are linked to antibiotic 
resistance. New strategies for combatting tolerance and persistence in biofilms and possible 
methods for biofilm eradication are highlighted to inspire future development.

Introduction

We live in societies made of individuals with interacting social connections and enduring 
architectural infrastructures. On a six order of magnitude smaller scale, bacterial cells also 
build microbial cities called biofilms in which individual cells and groups of cells interact 
and a global infrastructure is assembled. Biofilms are surface-attached communities of 
bacteria embedded in an extracellular matrix (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004). Biofilms can be 
beneficial for health, for example, as normal components of plant, animal, and human 
microbiomes and they can be crucial for effective industrial processes such as wastewater 
treatment. However, often, biofilms cause major problems: in medicine, biofilms underlie 
chronic infections, and in industry, biofilms foul surfaces of pipes and clog filtration devices.

Biofilm eradication, whether in medicine or industry, is remarkably difficult. One feature 
thought to underlie biofilm tenacity is that biofilm communities can harbor tolerant and 
persister cells (Lewis, 2005): cells that can survive transient antibiotic treatment and that 
regrow when the antibiotic is withdrawn (Brauner et al., 2016). Indeed, both hyper-biofilm-

forming mutants and mutants exhibiting enhanced persistence are isolated from patients with 
chronic infections (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004; Lewis, 2010). In this Mini Review, we 
summarize recent progress in the understanding of biofilm formation, focusing on the 
mechanical attributes of biofilms that endow them with their remarkable resilience. We 
highlight progress aimed at defining mechanisms underlying the tolerant and persister 
phenotypes. Finally, we provide an overview of exciting new strategies for combatting 
harmful bacterial biofilms.

Biofilm matrices: mechanical shelters for bacterial cells

A defining feature of a biofilm is the presence of the extracellular matrix, made up of 
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by the cells dwelling inside (Hall-
Stoodley et al., 2004). The EPS is usually a mixture of polysaccharides, proteins, 
extracellular DNA (eDNA), and other minor components. The physical and chemical 
properties of the biofilm matrix constituents coupled with their particular interactions give 
rise to the global biofilm mechanical properties. These properties allow the matrix to shield 
the resident cells from desiccation, chemical perturbation, invasion by other bacteria, and 
killing by predators. The matrix also provides the mechanical properties necessary to protect 
the cells from external forces such as fluid shear and to ensure the biofilm community 
remains attached to a surface. In the context of infectious biofilms, neutrophils can only 
ingest pathogens smaller than 10 μm, thus, participating in the biofilm lifestyle protects 
individual bacteria and small bacterial clusters from neutrophil attack. Moreover, to access 
biofilm-dwelling bacteria, neutrophils need to first break biofilms (~100 μm) into smaller 
pieces. However, neutrophils can only exert stress up to ~1 kPa during phagocytosis (Kovach 
et al., 2017), so biofilm mechanics could potentially prevent neutrophils from making 
biofilm cells available for killing.

Tools and concepts from the rheology field have been adapted to quantitatively define 
biofilm mechanical properties. Rheology is the study of viscoelastic materials: materials that 
have both solid and liquid properties (Billings et al., 2015). For rheologic measurements, 
biofilms are sandwiched between parallel plates and subjected to shearing (Figure 1A, Left). 
These analyses define the elastic modulus, which is the stiffness of the biofilm at small 
deformation, and the yield strain, which is how much deformation a biofilm can sustain 
before it fails (Figure 1A, Right) (Kovach et al., 2017). The product of the elastic modulus 
and the yield strain defines the yield stress, which is the minimum force needed to cause a 
biofilm to fail. Below we summarize insight gained from recent rheological measurements 
of three model biofilm forming species: Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 
Staphylococcus epidermidis.

V. cholerae is the causative agent of the pandemic disease cholerae. The major V. cholerae 
biofilm matrix component is the Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS) and there are three matrix 
proteins RbmA, Bap1, and RbmC (Teschler et al., 2015). Deletion of genes encoding matrix 
components, followed by rheological measurements, enabled the mechanical properties of V. 
cholerae biofilms to be defined (Yan et al., 2018). The V. cholerae biofilm can be described 
as a double-networked hydrogel with an elastic modulus of ~1kPa. One network is formed 
by the VPS polysaccharide reinforced by RbmC and Bap1, and the second network is

formed by the cells connected by RbmA (Figure 1B). Elimination of RbmA or RbmC/Bap1 
weakens the dual network and reduces the elastic modulus. Elimination of all three matrix 
proteins causes the VPS to swell, resulting in an increased yield strain but at the expense of a 
highly reduced elastic modulus. Only when all the matrix components are present do V. 
cholerae biofilms possess a large enough yield stress (~100 Pa) to withstand the flow 
regimes they experience in their natural habitat, for example, on sinking marine snow.

P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that forms chronic biofilm infections in patients 
with compromised immune systems, burns, in-dwelling devices, and cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Combinations of three polysaccharides can be present in the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix: 
Psl, Pel, and alginate (Kovach et al., 2017). Rheological measurements using the model 
virulent strain PAO1 and isolates from CF lungs show that Psl, together with its cross-
linking protein CdrA, are the main contributors to the biofilm elastic modulus (Kovach et al., 
2017). Overproduction of Pel increases the biofilm yield strain but does not alter the elastic 
modulus. Pel is positively changed and it binds eDNA (Jennings et al., 2015). Pel-eDNA 
interactions could be instrumental in driving overall biofilm mechanics, but this aspect has 
not yet been studied. Mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilms that overproduce alginate are fluid-like, 
possessing reduced elastic modulus and reduced yield stress compared to PAO1 biofilms 
(Gloag et al., 2018). In CF patients, cells in P. aeruginosa biofilms tend to increase both 
alginate and Psl production. Alginate overproduction causes a decrease in yield stress that is 
compensated for via overproduction of Psl. Together, these alterations enable the biofilm to 
preserve its original yield stress (Kovach et al., 2017). It is possible that maintaining a 
minimum yield stress is required for P. aeruginosa biofilm cells to avoid immune clearance. 
The unique combinations of matrix components displayed by different P. aeruginosa strains 
suggest that such blends promote distinct biofilm mechanical properties, each presumably 
optimized for a particular environmental condition.

S. epidermidis is a member of the human skin microbiome but also occurs in medical device 
and hospital acquired infections. The main S. epidermidis matrix component is called 
polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), a positively charged polymer (Otto, 2009). At 
low pH, purified PIA in solution possesses concentration-dependent viscoelasticity that is 
well described by the classical model of associative polymers: polymers that can both 
physically entangle and chemically interact through hydrogen bonding (Ganesan et al., 
2016). The main contribution to biofilm rheology, however, stems from chemical 
interactions, as the concentration of PIA in biofilms is too low for physical entanglement. At 
pH = 7 (or lower), PIA associates, becomes unstable in solution, and it phase separates 
together with the S. epidermidis cells to form biofilm-like structures with rheological 
properties similar to native S. epidermidis biofilms (Stewart et al., 2015). Indeed, simply 
increasing the pH above 7 was sufficient to stabilize PIA and make S. epidermidis biofilms 
more malleable. The strong pH-dependent phase behavior exhibited by PIA suggests S. 
epidermidis biofilms may possess distinct mechanical properties in particular local infection 
environments.

Biofilm architectures: from individual cells to macroscopic communities

Until recently, there was little understanding of how cells are arranged within biofilms and 
how 3D biofilm structures are built cell by cell. Custom high-resolution confocal 
microscopy technologies and companion imaging analysis algorithms were developed that 
enabled investigation of biofilms at single cell resolution. Initially, high-resolution confocal 
laser scanning microscopy was used to extract spatial information regarding fixed cells in S. 
epidermidis biofilms (Stewart et al., 2013). By tracking the centers of the spherical cells and 
analyzing the local cell density and cluster distribution, local biofilm compactness 
parameters were defined and were discovered to vary within an S. epidermidis biofilm. In 
regions with high and medium cell density, nearly all of the cells were present in a single 
cluster that exhibited characteristics of a dense disordered fluid. In regions of sparse cell 
density, cell clusters displayed open, fractal features similar to colloidal gels. Upon osmotic 
stresses (high salt concentration) or antibiotic challenge (vancomycin), however, the S. 
epidermidis biofilm structure only exhibited the low-density phenotype. The mechanism(s) 
driving these regional packing differences is unclear. We hypothesize that, as highlighted in 
the preceding section, local variations in pH or in PIA concentration that alter PIA solution 
behavior could lead to distinct biofilm packing density phenotypes.

Images of fixed V. cholerae cells obtained at different times during biofilm formation were 
acquired to learn how cell arrangement changes as biofilms mature (Drescher et al., 2016). 
The community transitions from a 2D branched morphology to a dense 3D cluster. In the 
mature V. cholerae biofilm cluster, vertical cells reside at the biofilm center and radially 
orientated cells are at the periphery. This entire sequence of structural transitions was 
subsequently visualized in living, growing V. cholerae biofilms (Figure 2A–B) (Yan et al., 
2016). Mutagenesis coupled with matrix labeling showed that V. cholerae biofilms lacking 
cell-surface adhesion due to deletion of rbmC and bap1 exhibit normal cell density but show 
no cell ordering. By contrast, biofilms lacking cell-cell connections due to deletion of rbmA 
display reduced cell packing density and enhanced vertical cell alignment.

To explore the forces driving structural transitions in V. cholerae biofilms, agent-based 
simulations were developed to investigate cell-surface interactions (Beroz et al., 2018). 
When a biofilm begins to form on a surface, it expands outward from the founder cell, as a 
one-cell-layer thick 2D film. During expansion, cells experience increasing mechanical 
pressure as they divide and push against their neighbors. These neighboring cells, in turn, 
resist the pushing force via surface adhesion. Ultimately, the pressure from pushing exceeds 
the cell-to-surface adhesion force and causes individual cells to reorient at the center of the 
biofilm where the pressure is the greatest. Cells transition from aligning parallel to aligning 
perpendicular to the substrate. When verticalized cells divide, they place their offspring 
further into the third dimension, thus the biofilm gradually transitions from a 2D surface 
layer to a mature 3D community (Figure 2C). To bolster these theoretical arguments, V. 
cholerae cell lengths were manipulated using chemicals. The timing of verticalization was 
altered: biofilms with shorter (longer) cells transitioned from 2D to 3D earlier (later) than 
cells of normal length, because shorter (longer) cells required lower (higher) critical forces 
to drive verticalization. A consequence of altering cell length was to change the overall 
width to height ratio of the resulting biofilm (Figure 2D).

Tolerance and persistence: how bacterial cells survive antibiotic challenge

Antibiotic resistance is caused by mutations that make a bacterial cell impervious to the 
toxic effect of the antibiotic, endowing that cell and its descendants with a selective growth 
advantage over non-resistant cells. Beyond classic resistance mechanisms, bacteria can 
display “tolerance”, the ability to survive transient exposure to high concentrations of an 
antibiotic (Brauner et al., 2016). Tolerant bacteria grow slower or have longer non-growing 
lag times when they exit stationary phase than their non-tolerant counterparts. Common 
targets of antibiotics, e.g., RNA polymerase, cell-wall biosynthetic enzymes, exhibit low 
activity in non-growing cells, and thus, slow-growing or non-growing cells can evade killing. 
In this respect, tolerance differs fundamentally from resistance, as resistance is usually 
specific to one antibiotic or one class of antibiotics.

Tolerant cells display a longer minimum duration of killing by an antibiotic than non-
tolerant cells, enabling tolerant cells to enjoy a selective advantage during transient or 
periodic antibiotic treatment (Brauner et al., 2016). Indeed, tolerant Escherichia coli cells 
spontaneously arose after repeated cycles of ampicillin treatment (Fridman et al., 2014). The 
increased lag time the E. coli cells exhibited matched the duration of ampicillin exposure. 
Because antibiotic treatment usually occurs in timed doses, patients experience periodic 
fluctuations in antibiotic concentration, likely favoring the emergence of tolerant cells.

Mutations in genes encoding a methionyl-tRNA synthetase, ribose-phosphate 
diphosphokinase, and toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules all promote tolerance by extending lag 
phase (Fridman et al., 2014). It is hypothesized that a sequential relationship exists between 
bacterial tolerance and bacterial resistance. Indeed, in an experiment probing periodic 
ampicillin treatment that mimicked medical practice, resistant E. coli strains isolated at the 
end of the experiment all arose from ancestral, tolerant strains (Figure 3A) (Levin-Reisman 
et al., 2017). The logic is that tolerance mutations occur more frequently than resistance 
mutations due to a larger target size of the former: there are many genes that when mutated 
confer tolerance while mutations in only a few genes confer resistance to a particular 
antibiotic. Once a tolerant mutant becomes established in the population, its presence gives 
the rarer, resistance mutations more opportunities to occur (Brauner et al., 2016; Levin-
Reisman et al., 2017).

Another form of tolerance, not obtained through heritable mutations but rather through 
phenotypic differentiation, is called persistence (Balaban et al., 2004; Lewis, 2005). 
Originally observed by Bigger (Bigger, 1944), bacterial persistence is receiving renewed 
interest due to its medical relevance, in particular, in the context of biofilms (Lewis, 2005). 
Time dependent antibiotic killing of a bacterial population shows that actively growing cells 
are killed first whereas persister cells are killed in a second phase at a much lower rate. 
Visualization of individual bacterial cells established that, prior to antibiotic treatment, an 
exponentially growing bacterial population contains a pre-existing fraction of non-growing 
cells (Balaban et al., 2004). It is this sub-population that survives antibiotic treatment and 
regrows after the antibiotic is withdrawn. Another source of persister cells are those that 
have become dormant during stationary phase. Such cells are simply carried over to the new 
culture upon sub-culturing.

The mechanisms driving subpopulations of cells to enter the persistent state are the subject 
of intense research and debate. One mechanism involves toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules 
(Lewis, 2005; Rotem et al., 2010). Indeed, the first identified high-persistence E. coli strain 
harbors a mutation in hipAB encoding a TA module (Moyed and Bertrand, 1983). The HipA 
toxin is a serine-protein kinase that phosphorylates GltX, a glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. HipA 
is inactivated by the companion antitoxin HipB (Schumacher et al., 2015). When HipA 
levels exceed a threshold in a cell due to stochastic fluctuations, protein synthesis is 
inhibited, and as a consequence, cell growth is arrested (Rotem et al., 2010). Growth-
arrested cells can become persisters. The originally isolated high-persister strain possesses a 
mutation that impairs HipA-HipB binding (Schumacher et al., 2015), which increases the 
chances of cells of this strain entering the growth-arrested state. TA modules do not appear 
to underlie persistence in Staphylococcus aureus as elimination of all TAs had no effect on 
persister cell formation (Conlon et al., 2016). Rather, some S. aureus cells stochastically 
enter into stationary phase earlier than others to become persister cells. In this case, 
stationary phase entry is accompanied by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, which, in 
turn, reduces the activity of ATP-dependent antibiotic targets (DNA gyrase, DNA 
topoisomerase, RNA polymerases, etc.). Therefore, stationary phase S. aureus cells are 
naturally prone to becoming persister cells. Lastly, genomic studies of E. coli and P. 
aeruginosa have identified many metabolic genes connected to persister cell formation 
(Amato et al., 2014).

Normally, persister cells make up from 10−2 to 10−5 of a population, so such cells might 
seemingly not be clinically relevant given that the goal of antibiotic treatment is to eliminate 
the majority of actively growing pathogens and to expect the immune system to clear the 
remainder (Lewis, 2010). However, persister cells may be dangerous to particular patient 
populations. In immunocompromised individuals, persister cells can likely regrow. In some 
diseases such as tuberculosis, antibiotic treatment must drive pathogens to very low numbers 
to achieve a clinical outcome. In such cases, persister cells could be problematic. In chronic 
infections, such as those in CF patients, high-persister mutants can be isolated after 
prolonged antibiotic treatment (Lewis, 2010). In these real-life cases, persister cells could be 
present and not eliminated by current drug regimes.

Tolerance and persistence in bacterial biofilms

The ability of biofilms to house tolerant and persister cells is proposed to underlie the 
difficulties encountered in eliminating biofilms during chronic infections (Lewis, 2005). 
Impeded antibiotic penetration into biofilms was initially proposed to be responsible, 
however it is now known that the matrix mesh size is much larger than antibiotic molecules 
(Ganesan et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2018), and most antibiotics do not interact strongly with 
biofilm matrix components (Spoering and Lewis, 2001). Rather, increased antibiotic 
tolerance and persistence in biofilms likely arises from altered physiology of biofilm cells. 
Cells buried inside thick biofilms could be in stationary phase, as penetration of nutrients 
and oxygen are known to be limited due to consumption by peripherally-located cells 
(Walters et al., 2003). Indeed, increasing evidence supports similarities between the 
physiological states of biofilm-dwelling cells and stationary phase planktonic cells. For 
example, the levels of persister cell formation by P. aeruginosa are comparable in the biofilm

state and in stationary phase (Spoering and Lewis, 2001). Likewise, antibiotic tolerance 
phenotypes of S. aureus biofilm cells, stationary phase planktonic cells, and persister cells 
are strikingly similar. (Waters et al., 2016). Nutrient starvation, a common environmental 
situation encountered during both biofilm formation and entrance into stationary phase could 
promote antibiotic tolerance and persister cell formation by triggering the stringent response 
(Nguyen et al., 2011). In P. aeruginosa biofilms, disabling the stringent response via deletion 
of both relA and spoT leads to a 1,000-fold reduction in cell survival upon antibiotic 
treatment. The Δ relA Δ spoT mutant cells possess impaired antioxidant defenses and 
increased oxidant production, which, together, sensitize the cells to antibiotic treatment and 
to nutrient limitation. Indeed, even in the absence of antibiotics, spontaneous death of the 
Δ relA Δ spoT P. aeruginosa cells occurs in the nutrient-limited interior regions of biofilm 
clusters (Figure 3B). Although there are some results suggesting specific genes drive 
persister cell formation exclusively in biofilms (Harrison et al., 2009), the current notion is 
that mechanisms underlying persister cell formation under planktonic conditions apply to 
persister cell formation in biofilms.

Even if the mechanisms giving rise to persister cells in biofilms and in planktonic 
environments are similar or identical, persister cells in in vivo biofilms could be particularly 
tenacious because the biofilm matrix provides a physical barrier that protects the persister 
cells from immune components (Lewis, 2005). As mentioned above, in vivo biofilm stiffness 
could exceed the maximum mechanical stress neutrophils are capable of exerting, in the 
present context, preventing neutrophils from accessing persister cells buried deep in the 
interior of a biofilm. Moreover, the rigidity of the biofilm matrix scaffold remains even if the 
majority of the biofilm cells have been killed by antibiotics (Zrelli et al., 2013). Such 
residual structures could harbor tolerant or persister cells that can regrow and cause recurrent 
infections.

New strategies to target tolerant and persister cells in biofilms

The notion that biofilms provide a “safe haven” for persister cells to arise and evade 
antibiotics and immune components suggests that entire biofilm structures must be removed 
from infection sites for successful elimination of pathogens. Mechanical debridement 
(scraping of biofilms from wounds) is the standard-of-care for chronic wounds (Gordon et 
al., 2017). However, it is difficult to completely remove all cells once a biofilm is sheared 
into pieces. Moreover, this arduous process can only be applied to infected regions that are 
exposed and thus amenable to mechanical manipulation. To address this challenge, a 
capillary peeling method has been developed in which liquid is slowly applied to a biofilm 
grown at an air-solid interface and capillary forces gently peel the biofilm off in its entirety 
(Yan et al., 2018). This method applies to a variety of surfaces including metals, hydrogels, 
and membranes and to biofilms formed by different bacterial species. This new method does 
not yet address situations in which biofilms are submerged or reside internally in patients.

In instances of internal biofilms, chemicals that induce biofilm dispersal have been pursued 
alone or in combination with antibiotic treatment. Examples include Dispersin B that 
degrades poly-N-acetylglucosamine, a common biofilm matrix component (McDougald et 
al., 2012). An unsaturated fatty acid produced by P. aeruginosa, cis-2-decenoic acid, can

trigger the dispersal of cells from biofilms formed by a range of bacteria including P. 
aeruginosa itself (Davies and Marques, 2009). Once the bacterial cells are dispersed into the 
solution, they become vulnerable to clearance by the immune system and/or killing by 
antibiotics. To date, Dispersin B is marketed as an ingredient in a wound care gel and as a 
medical device coating. In both cases, when Dispersin B is combined with antibiotics, the 
compound shows efficacy in prevention of bacterial infections (Kaplan, 2010).

Regarding targeting and eliminating tolerant or persistent cells, E. coli and S. aureus 
persister cells in biofilms can be re-sensitized to an aminoglycoside antibiotic by providing 
metabolites that generate a proton-motive force facilitating aminoglycoside uptake (Allison 
et al., 2011). Interestingly, the above dispersal promoting molecule cis-2-decenoic acid can 
also transform P. aeruginosa and E. coli persister cells from dormant to metabolically active 
(Marques et al., 2014). Again, this change renders the cells susceptible to antibiotics. 
Another good example is provided by the acyldepsipeptide antibiotic ADEP4, which kills 
persister cells in S. aureus biofilms via activation of ClpP (Conlon et al., 2013). ADEP4-
activated ClpP exhibits promiscuous protease activity, cleaves essential proteins, and causes 
persister cells to die. Together with rifampicin, ADEP4 treatment successfully eradicated S. 
aureus biofilms both in vitro and in a mouse model.

Other clever strategies to eliminate chronic infections are being developed and have potential 
for use to combat persister cells in biofilms. Here, we provide one new example as a 
representative to highlight these emerging applications. The membranes of S. aureus and 
other Gram-positive bacteria contain functional membrane microdomains (FMM) similar to 
lipid rafts in eukaryotic membranes. The FMM of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) 
contain a high level of staphyloxanthin, an essential membrane-bound antioxidant. 
Illuminating MRSA with blue light promotes degradation of staphyloxanthin and sensitizes 
MRSA to reactive oxygen attack, both in the planktonic and biofilm states. Treatment with 
light was effective in a mouse wound infection model (Dong et al., 2019). Whether such a 
mechanism is generalizable remains to be tested, and the delivery method (light in this case) 
might also restrict its use due to penetration issues for thick tissues.

Perspectives

Biofilm formation and persister cell formation can be viewed as two types of collective 
bacterial behaviors. In the case of biofilm formation, bacterial cells collectively produce 
extracellular matrices, a public good that profits the entire community. In the case of 
persister cell formation, the entire population benefits when, a subpopulation of cells 
survives a hostile environment in which the majority of cells perish. Combining these two 
collective lifestyles endows the bacteria with powerful mechanisms to survive harsh 
perturbations, including mechanical stress and antibiotic treatment. This good news for the 
bacteria presents humanity with a serious challenge regarding chronic infections.

To address this challenge, a deeper understanding of the biofilm formation process, biofilm 
mechanics, tolerance, and persistence is necessary. We expect new technologies to provide 
insight into how biofilm mechanics arise from particular steps in biofilm development and 
the features mechanics provide to these living structures. Simultaneous single-cell resolution

biofilm imaging and rheological measurements will allow interesting questions to be 
answered including: what happens at the single-cell level during biofilm failure or 
detachment? How does the biofilm internal structure evolve as the biofilm relaxes stress? 
How does local cellular configuration determine the local biofilm stiffness and do weak 
regions exist in biofilms that could be exploited to drive failure? Such measurements could 
provide a comprehensive understanding of biofilms as dynamic living materials.

Regarding tolerant and persister cells, additional evidence is required to confirm their 
presence in biofilms, especially in vivo during disease. Single-cell visualization of the 
process of tolerant/persister cell birth to non-growth to rejuvenation in a biofilm will yield 
valuable information. Questions that can be addressed include: Where and when do tolerant/
persister cells arise in spatially-structured biofilms and what is their spatial distribution? 
Which cells enjoy the mechanical protection provided by the matrix, what selects them, and 
are their locations pre-defined or random? How do persistent/tolerant cells deal with debris 
left by cells that have been killed by antibiotics? Ultimately, a deep understanding of the 
behaviors of all cells in biofilms, both at the individual and collective levels, could lead to 
currently unimaginable strategies to combat harmful biofilms and to promote beneficial 
biofilms.

Biofilms are surface-associated bacterial communities that play both beneficial and 
harmful roles in nature, in medicine, and in industry. Here, we review recent progress 
aimed at understanding the mechanical features that drive biofilm resilience, and the 
mechanisms underlying why biofilm-dwelling cells are tolerant and persistent to 
antibiotic treatment.

Biofilm mechanics. (A) Left: schematic of a rheometer setup for measuring biofilm 
mechanics. Biofilms (yellow) are sandwiched between a rotating (red arrow) shaft and a 
stationary plate (gray stripes). Right: Representative storage modulus G’ and loss modulus 
G” curves as a function of shear strain ε measured for a V. cholerae biofilm. G’ and G” 
correspond to the elastic and viscous responses of the biofilm, respectively. From the curve, 
the elastic modulus G’p and the yield strain εY are extracted. (B) Schematic of V. cholerae 
biofilm matrix components and how they contribute to biofilm mechanical properties. Cells 
(yellow cylinders) interact through surface lipopolysaccharides (black curvy lines) or by 
crosslinking via RbmA (green symbols). VPS (red wavy lines) is crosslinked by RbmC and 
Bap1, both depicted as blue dots. Removal of RbmC and Bap1 causes the VPS to swell.
