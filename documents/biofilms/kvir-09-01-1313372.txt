ABSTRACT
Bioﬁlm refers to the complex, sessile communities of microbes found either attached to a surface or
buried ﬁrmly in an extracellular matrix as aggregates. The bioﬁlm matrix surrounding bacteria
makes them tolerant to harsh conditions and resistant to antibacterial treatments. Moreover, the
bioﬁlms are responsible for causing a broad range of chronic diseases and due to the emergence of
antibiotic resistance in bacteria it has really become difﬁcult
them with efﬁcacy.
Furthermore, the antibiotics available till date are ineffective for treating these bioﬁlm related
infections due to their higher values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum
bactericidal concentration (MBC), which may result in in-vivo toxicity. Hence, it is critically important
to design or screen anti-bioﬁlm molecules that can effectively minimize and eradicate bioﬁlm
related infections. In the present article, we have highlighted the mechanism of bioﬁlm formation
with reference to different models and various methods used for bioﬁlm detection. A major focus
has been put on various anti-bioﬁlm molecules discovered or tested till date which may include
herbal active compounds, chelating agents, peptide antibiotics, lantibiotics and synthetic chemical
compounds along with their structures, mechanism of action and their respective MICs, MBCs,
minimum bioﬁlm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs) as well as the half maximal
inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values available in the literature so far. Different mode of action of anti bioﬁlm
molecules addressed here are inhibition via interference in the quorum sensing pathways, adhesion
mechanism, disruption of extracellular DNA, protein, lipopolysaccharides, exopolysaccharides and
secondary messengers involved in various signaling pathways. From this study, we conclude that
the molecules considered here might be used to treat bioﬁlm-associated infections after signiﬁcant
structural modiﬁcations, thereby investigating its effective delivery in the host. It should also be
ensured that minimum effective concentration of these molecules must be capable of eradicating
bioﬁlm infections with maximum potency without posing any adverse side effects on the host.

Introduction

Bioﬁlm refers to the complex communities of microbes
that may be found attached to a surface or may form
aggregates without adhering to a surface, as seen in Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and some
other bacteria1-3 and buried ﬁrmly in an extracellular
matrix (ECM). The bioﬁlm lifestyle allows the bacteria to
withstand hostile environmental conditions like starva-
tion, desiccation and makes them capable to cause a
broad range of chronic diseases. Hence, it is considered
as a major cause of persistent nosocomial infections in
immune-compromised patients.4,5 Around 50% of the
nosocomial infections are conﬁned to the patients by
indwelling devices used for the purpose of medical treat-
joint
ments such as catheters, cardiac pacemakers,

prosthesis, dentures, prosthetic heart valves and contact
lenses.6,7 These foreign bodies provide an ideal surface
for the attachment of bacterial cells. Thus a signiﬁcant
increase in bioﬁlm formation has been observed in the
presence of implants.8 In many cases, the use of antibiot-
ics like imipenem, colistin and many more can only
reduce the bioﬁlms but cannot eliminate the entire bio-
ﬁlm. Due to their toxic and side effects it is not possible
to reach the minimal concentration of antibiotic in-vivo.
The higher values of MIC and MBC for the bioﬁlm bac-
terial cells have therefore made the antibiotic treatment
less adequate.6,9-11

Moreover, bioﬁlms protect

the invading bacteria
against the immune system of host via impaired activa-
tion of phagocytes and complement system12-14 and also

increase their resistance against the conventional antibiot-
ics by around 1000-fold.2,6,15-20 Some other factors may
also account for this antimicrobial tolerance. Previous
experimental works revealed several reasons behind the
resistance, which includes nature and structure of bioﬁlm,
nutrient and oxygen availability to the bacterial cells and
intrinsic and acquired bacterial resistance. The involve-
ment of bioﬁlm in providing resistance was made evident
from a study on P. aeruginosa where the mucoid nature
of bioﬁlm was found responsible for high resistance
toward tobramycin.21 The metabolic state of bioﬁlm-asso-
ciated bacteria is another potential reason of antimicrobial
resistance. Cells of
the nutrient depleted zones (slow
growing state) in the bioﬁlm may lead to dormancy like
the stationary phase which makes the bacteria insensitive
to antibiotics since they divide very infrequently.22,23
Dividing cells are sensitive to some antibiotics including b
lactams, thereafter making them unﬁt for use. Walters
et al. reported that antibiotic resistance was also inﬂu-
enced by limited oxygen supply as observed in case of P.
aeruginosa, where antibiotic was effective at the air-bioﬁlm
interface, the part of the bioﬁlm exposed to oxygen (50–
90 mm in the bioﬁlm).24 Moreover, studies also demon-
strate that bioﬁlm cells undergo a higher rate of mutation
than their planktonic counterparts resulting in a 10-fold
increase in the efﬁciency of transfer of plasmid having
antibiotic resistance gene, when bioﬁlm is exposed to a
sub-lethal concentration of that antibiotic.25

Bjarnsholt et al. demonstrated that mucoid bioﬁlms
observed in the samples of cystic ﬁbrosis lungs were not
found adhered to the lung epithelia, instead were adhered
to the neighboring bacteria embedded in a biopolymeric
matrix known as aggregated form.2 These ﬁndings were
subsequently conﬁrmed in the studies performed by other
researchers1,3 suggesting that non-surface attached aggre-
gates exhibit similar levels of tolerance to various antibiot-
ics and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) as surface
attached bioﬁlms. The properties of non-surface attached
aggregates despite being similar to that of bioﬁlms, exhibit
some differences like they have higher metabolic activity
than cells in bioﬁlm as well as planktonic cells. These
aggregates have also been reported to be involved in
chronic infections and wounds26,27 and middle ear infec-
tions.28 So, the necessity to ﬁnd new effective drugs that
could disperse and eliminate the bioﬁlm is of major con-
cern to prevent and treat various infections caused by
generation of bioﬁlms.

Therefore, the study of bioﬁlm and the strategies to
eliminate them is one of the most important ﬁelds of
research in the present days. Many reviews on anti-bio-
ﬁlm compounds have already been done, but this review
focuses especially on different strategies or targets of bio-
ﬁlm inhibition. A recent review by Wu et al. has

discussed few strategies to combat bioﬁlm. These strate-
gies include the removal of infected foreign bodies like
stents and implants and replacing them with new unin-
fected ones, inhibition of the quorum sensing pathway
and modiﬁcation of c-di-GMP to reduce bioﬁlm infec-
tions.6 Here, we have made an effort to compile all the
known strategies or targets for combating bioﬁlm, which
may help the researchers to design new molecules having
anti-bioﬁlm activity. Here, we have also discussed the
mechanism of bioﬁlm formation with respect to different
models followed by various bioﬁlm detection methods
along with detailed discussion of the mechanism of
action of anti-bioﬁlm molecules found till date. Many of
the compounds that exhibit anti-bioﬁlm activity need to
undergo further modiﬁcations and in-vivo tests followed
by clinical trials before using them commercially.

Bioﬁlm formation

electrostatic

Bioﬁlm formation on any surface involves mainly 3
stages. The ﬁrst stage involves attachment of cells to
a surface followed by assembly of the cells to form
microcolonies and ﬁnally differentiation of bioﬁlm
into a mature structure. After the complete develop-
ment of bioﬁlm,
its disassembly or dispersion takes
place through both mechanical and active processes.29
Deposition of bacteria is especially mediated by sedi-
mentation, Brownian motion and hydrodynamic
forces, whereas adhesion to the substratum is gov-
erned by Lifshitz–Van der Waals, acid–base, hydro-
interaction forces.30 Certain
phobic,
surface associated proteins like OmpA, ﬁbronectin
binding proteins,31 protein A,32 SasG,33,34 bioﬁlm
associated protein (BAP)35,36 and many other factors
are involved in the formation of bioﬁlms, particularly,
during initial attachment stages. Some species cannot
attach to a surface but can anchor themselves to the
matrix or directly to the earlier colonies. Small signal-
ing molecules with the help of cell-cell communica-
tion
This
phenomenon is generally referred to as quorum sens-
ing.37 Bioﬁlm formation is a major quorum-sensing
controlled phenotype.38 In bioﬁlms, the bacterial cells
are enclosed in an extracellular matrix, which is a
complex and highly polar mixture of biomolecules
including proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids and
lipids.39 The matrix provides protection from various
stress conditions such as antimicrobial exposure or
immune cells attack. However, the matrix of the bio-
ﬁlm does not act as a mechanical barrier for the anti-
microbial agent.40 This was conﬁrmed by a study
which shows that bioﬁlm formed by b-lactamase-deﬁ-
cient strain of K. pneumoniae, allowed the penetration

of ampicillin whereas in wild type K. pneumoniae
strain possessing b-lactamase, ampicillin was unable
to inﬁltrate bioﬁlm,40 suggesting that
in the latter
case, ampicillin was rapidly degraded by b-lactamase
before inﬁltrating the wild type bioﬁlm. Once the bac-
teria start secreting extracellular polysaccharide sub-
stance (EPS), second stage of development of bioﬁlm
comes in process, which is an irreversible process.
The secretion of EPS is continuous till the third stage
of formation ensuring the safe attachment of bacteria
to the surface inside a thickly complex bio-molecular
layer.41 The fully matured bioﬁlm now takes on a
tower-like structure having 3 dimensions. These tow-
small channels, which transport
ers comprise of
nutrients, water and waste, and the small cavities
present in the towers provide shelter for the plank-
tonic bacteria. Studies also demonstrate that the orga-
nization and architecture of bioﬁlms vary greatly for
different bacteria. Exact
this variation
remains unclear. However, the adhesive protein LapA
governs the bioﬁlm formation of P. putida42-44 while
exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl govern bioﬁlm forma-
tion in other pseudomonads
including P. aerugi-
nosa.45-47 Hence, difference in extracellular matrix
(ECM) component may give rise to the variations in
the structure of bioﬁlm. Finally, these towers either
erode (small parts) or are sloughed off (large parts)
and get detached, emptying the cavities containing
non-surface attached bacteria. This is followed by the
release of fresh bacteria into the environment.48,49

reason for

Some recent studies on various bacterial species such
as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseu-
domonas ﬂuorescens, Yersinia pestis, Escherichia coli,
Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Salmonella
enterica, Clostridium difﬁcle, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vib-
rio cholerae and Bacillus subtilis demostrate that increase
in c-di-GMP level, an intracellular secondary messenger
designates the initiation of bioﬁlm formation and viru-
lence.42,43,50-58,59-63 c-di-GMP was ﬁrst described as a
novel secondary messenger in the allosteric activation of
cellulose synthase of Gluconacetobacter xylinus.55 Several
types of c-di-GMP diguanylate cyclase and phosphodies-
terases that are synthesized by bacteria participate in dif-
ferent c-di-GMP circuits.64 c-di-GMP functions by
binding to a wide range of receptors which include
enzymes, adaptor proteins,
transcription factors and
riboswitches.61 It has also been reported that various
environment causes and transducer mechanisms lead to
an increase in the c-di-GMP level in the cell. This not
only leads to the production of adhesins but also helps in
the secretion of extracellular matrix.65,66 In P. aeruginosa,
the level of c-di-GMP positively regulates the production
such as CdrA
of extracellular matrix components

adhesin, alginate exo-polysaccharide, Pel and Psl.53,67
Along with c-di-GMP, small regulatory RNAs (sRNA)
also regulate the formation of bioﬁlm in several bacterial
species.68

Certain bacterial strains have the ability to form
planktonic aggregates, which depend on growth condi-
that some strains of
tions. Previous studies suggest
S. aureus form large aggregates and the formation pro-
cess starts in the early exponential growth phase. A clus-
ter of about 20 cells form a structured population when
cell density is low. However, at higher density these
structures are larger forming aggregates up to diameter
of 1000mm. Extracellular polysaccharide intracellular
adhesin (referred as polymers of b 1–6 N-acetylglucos-
amine or PNAG after determination of the chemical
structure),69 and spa encoding Protein A are reported to
be responsible for the extensive aggregation.3 Studies by
Alhede et al. 2011 suggested that the matrix of aggregates
of P. aeruginosa comprises of DNA and mannose-rich
extracellular polysaccharide like Psl.1

Bioﬁlm models

Study of various bioﬁlm model systems enhances the
knowledge regarding the bioﬁlm biology. The bioﬁlms
are studied using both in-vivo and in-vitro model
systems. In-vitro bioﬁlm model systems are broadly clas-
siﬁed into 3 major types including closed or static model,
open or dynamic models and microcosms. The most
frequently used closed model systems are microtitre
plate-based model systems which uses static and batch
growth conditions.70 In this model, there is no ﬂow of
media, product or waste materials into or out of the reac-
tor, so the experimental conditions changes gradually in
the wells like accumulation of signaling components,
increase of bacterial population and depletion of
nutrients in media. Since, it is cost effective and require
small volume of reagents therefore, numerous tests can
be performed at a single time.71 Additionally, microtitre
plate-based models can be used to differentiate between
bioﬁlm-deﬁcient mutants and bioﬁlm forming wild type
strains,72,73 determine the antimicrobial and anti-bioﬁlm
effects of different antimicrobial compounds, identify the
factors involved in the bioﬁlm initiation such as adhe-
sins, pili, ﬂagella, enzymes involved in cyclic-di-GMP
metabolism and genes responsible for extracellular poly-
saccharide production.74,75 Among the open and
dynamic models, ﬂow displacement bioﬁlm model
is
most commonly used to study bioﬁlms. Unlike the
microtitre plate method, in this model system, addition
of nutrients and release of waste products can occur.70,76
The dynamic model of bioﬁlm formation using perfused
silicone tubes is one of the most important models for

studying bioﬁlms as it initiates in-vivo conditions very
closely. Bioﬁlms are formed in a silicone tube system
under dynamic condition followed by cutting of the tube
in small pieces for further treatment and investigation.77
Microcosms constitute another in-vitro model system for
studying bioﬁlms that mimic with the in situ conditions
in controlled environment, such as for studying wound
bioﬁlm, oral bioﬁlm, stream bioﬁlm and dental bio-
ﬁlm.78-80 Both in-vitro and in-vivo systems can be turned
into a microcosm by using the same medium and creat-
ing an artiﬁcial environment to assess the cell metabo-
lism and behavior. Apart from this there exists an ex-
vivo model system, which deals with the tissues and
organs extracted from organisms for the further analysis
and experimentation in artiﬁcial environment. This
model can be useful to monitor the bacterial colonization
and progression in the given tissue or organ. To validate
the simpliﬁed results provided by the in-vitro model
studies, certain in-vivo model system studies should be
performed. To address various therapeutic and diagnos-
tic challenges the studies of mammalian models closer to
the humans is necessary. These tissue-associated model
systems are being used for studying mainly lung infec-
tions, urinary tract infections as well as the wound infec-
tions.74,81 Different other models such as central venous
catheter models; subcutaneous foreign body infection
models; intra-peritoneal foreign body infection models;
urinary tract infection models; ear, nose and throat infec-
tion models; respiratory tract infection models and oste-
omyelitis infection models have been used for the study
of these infections.74 The use of mammalian model pos-
sess some difﬁculties that has made researchers to switch
over to the non-mammalian model system such as Dro-
sophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans or Danio
rerio.82 The advantages of these models reside in the very
short generation time and their lower cost. Moreover
their small sizes provide the ease to maintain them in
microtitre plates thus making it easier for high through-
put screening of bioﬁlm formation.

Methods for quantiﬁcation and structural
assessment of bioﬁlm

Bioﬁlm production can be assessed by several meth-
ods. The standard assay for screening the presence of
bioﬁlms is crystal violet (CV) assay by quantifying
the dye bound to cells on polystyrene and other
hydrophobic substratum. However, the limitation of
crystal violet assay includes its indirect nature, and
requires repeated washings, which may cause loss of
cells and above all the bioﬁlm has to be disrupted.83
Tissue Culture Plate (TCP) method84 is also one of
the most commonly practiced standard method and a

ﬂuorometry, which can be used to check the existence
and visualize the 3D structure of bioﬁlm.90-92 How-
ever, SEM is expensive and quantitation of the bio-
ﬁlm is difﬁcult. Information on bioﬁlm heterogeneity
and cell localization can be obtained via ﬂuorescence
staining coupled with CSLM followed by high-speed
computing. Reﬂectance assay is a semi-quantitative,
inexpensive, and nondestructive optical assay for bio-
ﬁlms on abiotic surfaces and to some extent on biotic
surfaces. This assay is capable of examining the status
and morphology of bioﬁlm formation and also reveals
the bioﬁlm forming ability of bacteria.93-95 To charac-
terize the chemistry of bioﬁlm NMR and FTIR can be
taken into use. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
imaging results demonstrate the water dynamics,
molecular dynamics and biomolecule diffusion within
bioﬁlms96,97 and analysis of Fourier Transform Infra-
red Spectroscopy (FTIR) along with Raman imaging

and cellular components. Raman imaging generates

interleukin-6 and pro-calcitonin level.104,105 In addi-
tion, ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used
for the diagnosis of bioﬁlm infections in cystic ﬁbrosis
and chronic wounds using either traditionally labeled
DNA probes or the Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)
probes, the latter having better attributes thereafter
providing information on community structure of
bioﬁlms.106-112 To measure anti-bioﬁlm activity, via-
bility and matrix biomass is assessed. For this, resa-
zurin and crystal violet
staining are performed
sequentially in the same plate. Wheatgerm agglutinin-
Alexa Fluor 488 ﬂuorescent conjugate are generally
used to stain the matrix. It is essential to measure the
bioﬁlm matrix, biomass and viability to investigate
the efﬁciency of antibiotic treatment.113 The different
methods of bioﬁlm detection with their principles are
enlisted in the Table 1.

Strategies to combat bioﬁlm formation

Since bioﬁlm formation contributes to the bacterial
pathogenicity and resistance toward antibiotics, there
must be certain strategies to deal with this problem.
Recently, Wu et al has reported the use of foreign
bodies as a major cause of increase in bioﬁlm infec-
tions.6 So, to treat such bioﬁlm associated infections
it
is imperative to remove the indwelling medical
equipment followed by replacement with new unin-
fected ones
and aggressive
administration of antibiotics. Moreover, the implant
removal should be timed properly so that the new or

replaced implant does not get infected when inserted
in the patient’s body. In cases where removal is not
possible a long-term administration of antibiotics is
recommended so as to avert the bioﬁlm from grow-
ing. According to the previous reports, the premature
bioﬁlms can be treated more effectively with antibiot-
ics than that of the mature bioﬁlms. However, the
inefﬁciency to diagnose premature bioﬁlms in the
body is the most crucial reason for the occurrence of
clinical
conditions, which are mostly related to
mature form of bioﬁlms.9-11,114 The antibiotic used
for the treatment of bioﬁlms should be legitimately
selected on the basis of sensitivity as well as the
capacity to penetrate properly through the bioﬁlm
matrix.6 It is evident from the previous studies that
bacteria underneath bioﬁlms are more resistant
to
antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. There-
fore, the use of combinatorial therapy is more prefer-
antibiotic monotherapy.115 The
able
combination of agents is advantageous due to differ-
ent functioning of the individual agents; for example,
one may be effective against dormant cells and other
against the growing cells. Moreover, the therapy also
requires proper dispensation of antibiotic in terms of
dosages and duration. The discovery of antifouling or

approach to prevent bioﬁlm formation.116 Polymeric
hydrophilic coatings such as PEG are used for build-

are loaded with different antibiotics.117,118 Coating
with nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles, anti-
oxidant nanoparticles can also be used for the preven-
tion of bioﬁlm formation.69,119 However, the coating
strategy has encountered difﬁculties as the surface
quickly gets eroded and hence becomes available for
the formation of bioﬁlms. Photodynamic therapy
(PDT) has potential applications in prevention of
wound bioﬁlm infections. Here, a photoactive dye is
used followed by irradiation in the presence of oxy-
thus killing the bacteria.120 During therapy,
gen,
proper care should be taken that patient’s eyes are
not exposed to laser light. With respect to photosensi-
tizer and photochemical reactions,
it is very crucial
that the therapy should be used carefully to stain and
kill the bacterial cells only without affecting the sur-
rounding tissues of the patient’s body. Another upris-
effective anti-bioﬁlm
ing strategy is
molecules or the bioﬁlm dissolving substances.121 The
anti-bioﬁlm molecules interfere with bacterial signal-
ing pathways in both Gram-positive and Gram-nega-
tive bacteria. The anti-bioﬁlm molecules may be any
enzyme, a peptide, an antibiotic, polyphenols etc. In
the present review, we have discussed about the dif-
ferent anti-bioﬁlm molecules discovered against dif-
ferent bacterial
infections. We have also highlighted
the mechanism of action of different available anti-
bioﬁlm molecules. This review will help to understand
and help
the
researchers working in the discovery of new antibiot-
ics for Gram-negative bacteria.

Anti-bioﬁlm molecules and their mechanism of
action

Anti-bioﬁlm molecules belong to diverse compounds
thereby inhibiting the bioﬁlm formation. The identiﬁed
anti-bioﬁlm compounds are mainly isolated from the
natural sources,122 some synthetic compounds, chelating
agents, and lantibiotics also have been found to possess
anti-bioﬁlm activity. The different anti-bioﬁlm molecules
along with their target microorganisms are listed in the
Table 2. These anti-bioﬁlm molecules follow different
mechanisms to inhibit bioﬁlm formation in different
bacteria as listed in Table 3.

population density as well as facilitate swarming motility.
These signaling molecules vary in their length, substitu-
tions on acyl side chains123 and are synthesized by a
LuxI-type synthase. Binding of these molecules at certain
critical concentrations, to a cognate LuxR-type transcrip-
tional activator protein regulates the target gene expres-
sion.124,125 A secondary metabolite derivative, synthetic
halogenated furanone (Fig. 2) compound is derived from
natural furanone produced by the Australian macroalga,
Dilsea pulchra. This compound has the capability to
interfere with bacterial signaling processes and motility
of swarm cells. It was also hypothesized that similarity in
the structure of D. pulchra furanones and AHL mole-
cules is responsible for affecting the interaction of puta-
tive regulatory protein with AHL molecules via binding
competitively to the receptor. Furanones inhibit surface
aggregation traits in ecologically relevant bacteria in eco-
logically relevant concentrations.126 Transcription of
lasB-gfp (ASV) reporter fusion, regulated by quorum
sensing is interfered by furanone 56 decreasing the extra-
cellular chitinase and elastase activity and having almost
no effect on the growth of the bacteria or in the protein
synthesis. Studies suggested that furanone targets the rhl
system which is involved in the quorum sensing and also
penetrates the bioﬁlm matrix of P. aeruginosa thereby
affecting the expression of genes related to quorum sens-
ing bioﬂm maturity. This molecule alters the structure of
the bioﬁlm which facilitates bacterial detachment at an
increased rate and results in the loss of biomass of the
bacteria from substratum.123 It was also discovered that
furanone mediates displacement of AHL molecules from
Lux R,127 which suggested the competence of furanone
with the cognate AHL signal for the LuxR receptor site.
At present, there are several experimental evidences
which support the observations about furanones such as,
repression of AHL-dependent expression of biolumines-
cence,127 inhibition of production and pathogenesis of
AHL-controlled virulence factor,123,128 and inhibition of
quorum sensing–controlled luminescence.129 Some pol-
yphenols (like EGCG, tannic acid, ellagic acid) (Fig. 2)
are believed to follow the similar mechanism to inhibit
bioﬁlm formation but due to their less efﬁciency than
furanones, they are required in higher concentration.38
Quercetin (Fig. 2), a ﬂavonoid, also inﬂuences quorum
sensing, hence acts as an anti-bioﬁlm compound against
S. aureus. It inhibits alginate production in a concentra-
tion dependent manner; resulting into declination in
the adherence during bioﬁlm formation. It also reduces
exopolysaccharide (EPS) production required for the
initial attachment of bacteria and leads to induction of
swarming motility.130 Apart from quercetin, 2 more
synthetic ﬂavanoids are also identiﬁed, which act as
the dispersed
potential antimicrobial agent against

reports also suggested that usinic acid show inhibitory
effect on the S. aureus bioﬁlm and affected the mor-
phology of bioﬁlm produced by P. aeruginosa.

Researchers have hypothesized that this may be due to
the exact
any interference in quorum sensing, but
still unclear.132 Curcumin

Inhibition of stringent response by bacteria

collectively

termed as

(p)ppGpp is

synthetase, RelQ. Previous works

A peptide named 1018-peptide works by inhibiting the
alarmone accumulation, which is a part of stringent
response by bacteria in response to nutritional stress.
During their stress conditions bacteria synthesize alar-
mones, namely; guanosine tetraphosphate and guano-
(p)
sine pentaphosphate,
ppGpp.134,135 Generally, 2 enzymes regulate the (p)
ppGpp metabolism:
the (p)ppGpp-synthetase/hydro-
lase, RelA (orRsh) with dual function and the small
by
alarmone
researchers suggest that during stress conditions, rapid
accumulation of
regulated by RelA
whereas RelQ is found responsible for low level of
expression of (p)ppGpp under no stress conditions.
in the case of a DrelA-
The absence of (p)ppGpp,
DrelQ double mutant strain, leads to reduced antibi-
otic tolerance and attenuated virulence.136 Studies also
revealed that any change in (p)ppGpp pool can
severely affect the bacterial bioﬁlm formation, develop-
ment and maintenance of its stable form in-vitro. The
RelA-mediated stringent response and helps in the cell
survival as during starvation conditions it can optimize
gene expression for growth and survival. Some results
prove the importance of the (p) ppGpp synthetase,
RelQ in bioﬁlm homeostasis. In case of DrelA DrelQ
strain, there occurs some severe defects during the for-
mation of bioﬁlm, its maturation and viability due to
uncontrolled consumption of energy resource, NAD/
NADH ratio imbalance, or amassing of the metabolic

effect with antibiotics

end products.137 Hence, the amphipathic cationic pep-
tide 1018 must establish direct contact with (p)ppGpp
by crossing through the cell membrane and reaching
protoplasm. The peptide disrupts the bioﬁlm in 3 pos-
sible manners. First, it prevents formation of bioﬁlm
when added before initiation step. Second, at much
speciﬁed low concentration it disrupts and kills the
bacteria present in bioﬁlm without affecting the plank-
tonic cells. Third, it can disperse mature bioﬁlm which
is 2 d old.134 It was also reported to exhibit signiﬁcant
against bioﬁlm
synergistic
formed by different bacteria.138 The peptide 1018 and
its derivatives HE4 and HE10 are found to be active
against P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia at concentra-
tions much below the MIC of their planktonic growth.
In contrast to the parent molecule 1018, these deriva-
tives exhibit equal or decreased level of anti-bioﬁlm
activity against bioﬁlm formed by P. aeruginosa, but
increased activity against methicillin resistant S. aureus
bioﬁlms.139 Peptide 1037 was also evident to reduce
bioﬁlms formed by many Gram- positive and Gram-
negative bacteria.140 Another peptide named, Peptide
1038140 induce twitching motility (which destroy bio-
ﬁlm), and inhibit adhesion and quorum sensing of
Pseudomonas involved in bioﬁlm formation. A second-
ary metabolite from Syzigium aromaticum, eugenol
(Fig. 3) treatment to S. mutans causes the downregula-
tion of gene, relA, involved in the control of stringent

Dispersion of extracellular polysaccharide
substance of bioﬁlm by enzymes

The Extracellular Polysaccharide Substance (EPS) of the
bioﬁlm protects the microorganisms from various anti-
microbial agents. The disorganization of the EPS would
expose the released as well as residual bioﬁlm cells to
these agents. There are certain enzymes such as polysac-
charide lyases and DNases that are capable of disrupting
the exo-polysaccharides.142 Likewise, DNase I and Dis-
persin B are the major enzymes that functions as poten-
tial anti-bioﬁlm agents.143,144 DNase I is capable of
digesting the extracellular DNA (eDNA) which is present
within the bioﬁlm structure whereas Dispersin B, a
glycoside hydrolase works by cleaving polymers of b 1–
6 N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), an extracellular poly-
saccharide substance which facilitates aggregation of bac-
teria. Also, it can disperse EPS layers present on medical
devices.143,144 These bioﬁlm-dispersing enzymes are
more efﬁcient when administered in combination with
antimicrobial agents in killing the bacteria embedded in
the EPS.145

Cleavage of peptidoglycan

The cleavage of peptidoglycan, which is present in the
cell wall of most of the bacteria inhibit bioﬁlm genera-
tion. Tannic acid, a polyphenolic compound, inhibits
bioﬁlm formation without affecting bacterial growth in
Staphylococcus aureus.146 The mechanism of action was
found to depend on the putative lytic transglycosylase,
an immune-dominant Staphylococcal Antigen A (IsaA),
which acts by cleaving peptidoglycan.147 These transgly-
colases are lysozyme-like enzyme which catalyzes the
cleavage of the b-1,4 glycosidic bond between N-acetyl
muramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetyl glucosamine
(GlcNAc).148 Tannic acid inhibits the formation of bio-
ﬁlms by increasing the extracellular level of IsaA.146
Cleavage of peptidoglycan reduces bioﬁlm formation by
several ways, such as; it alters the composition of pro-
teins and teichoic acids present on the cell wall. Peptido-
glycan cleavage may also result in the release of signaling
molecules149 that can modulate the bioﬁlm-related gene
expression. Bacteriophages encode a unique class of pep-
tidoglycan hydrolases referred as endolysins,150 which
digest the cell wall of bacteria so as to release progeny
bacteriophage. Endolysins usually work in a species-spe-
ciﬁc manner. They bind with the cell wall and cleave it,
which ultimately leads to hypotonic lysis and bacterial
death.151 Endolysins work on the multiple antibiotic

resistant strains. PlyC, a speciﬁc streptococcal bacterio-
phage endolysin,152-156 functions by disrupting the in-
vitro bioﬁlms. This bacteriophage therapy requires the
knowledge of the bacteria causing infections, for which
speciﬁc bacteriophages are needed to be design properly.
Another molecule, epigallocatechin gallate, a polyphenol,
inhibits bacteria by causing the cell wall damage via
binding with the peptidoglycan,157,158 thus interferes
with initial docking phase (mainly due to hydrophobic
interactions) of bioﬁlm formation.159

Inhibition through bioﬁlm disassembly

Bioﬁlm disassembly is a multistep process that involves
deterioration of the extracellular matrix and change in
the physiology of cell which prepares them to sustain in
conditions persisting beyond the boundary of the bio-
ﬁlm.160 Several bacterial species takes into account a pri-
mary mechanism of disassembly of bioﬁlms that include
the production of extracellular enzymes or surfactants
that leads to degradation as well as solubilization of
adhesive components in the matrix of bioﬁlm. The
matrix keep the cells enclosed within the bioﬁlm colony,
thus, upon its deterioration cells get detached from this
colony and are released in the environment. The active
bioﬁlm dispersal is mediated by certain matrix-degrading
gene products such as proteases, deoxyribonucleases
(DNases) and surfactants.

An accessory gene regulatory (agr) system present in
several bacteria, control the synthesis of bioﬁlm matrix
degrading enzymes. The agr system is mediated by a
cyclic auto-inducing peptide (AIP). At critical threshold
concentration (in the low nanomolar range), a 2-compo-
nent signal transduction cascade is activated by AIP
which results into the generation of virulence factors.161
The extracellular proteome of agr includes several pro-
teases and small pore-forming toxins known as phenol-
soluble modulins (PSMs).29,162,163 Thus, activation of the
agr system prevents bioﬁlm maturation, performing an
inhibitory role.29

The production of extracellular proteases (eg. sarA,
sigB, Esp) has been found to be associated with the bio-
ﬁlm disassembly mechanism.162,164,165 During bioﬁlm
disassembly, nuclease acts as an endogenous mediator. It
is an effective DNase (a thermonuclease or micrococcal
nuclease) that helps in the separation of cells from bio-
ﬁlms.166 In some species, when the DNases and restric-
tion enzymes are added exogenously, the bioﬁlms get
readily dispersed from microplate wells, which indicates
that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a major bioﬁlm matrix
moieties there.144,166 The amyloid-like ﬁbers and the
secretion of TasA protein have also been reported to play
an important role in the formation of bioﬁlms.167,168 The

detachment of these amyloid-like ﬁbers from the cell
surfaces lead to the disassembly of bioﬁlms.168 To
screen the anti-amyloid activities of molecules, B. subti-
lis bioﬁlms, being the simplest biologic system are
mainly preferred. AA-861 and parthenolide exhibit
inhibitory properties against bioﬁlms by B. subtilis, E.
coli and Bacillus cereus by interfering with the polymer-
ization of TasA into amyloid-like ﬁbers.168 E. coli and
other species of Enterobacteriaceae produce functional
amyloid ﬁbers named curli. Type 1 pili and curli plays
signiﬁcant roles in promoting bioﬁlm in E. coli. Some
earlier studies suggested that 2 analogs of FN075 and
BibC6 of ring-fused 2-pyridones are peptidomimetic
that target the protein–protein interactions in macro-
molecular assembly, blocking the synthesis of curli in
E. coli. Bacterial virulence is signiﬁcantly attenuated in
a mouse urinary tract infection model when E. coli was
pretreated with FN075.169 Additionally, Connolly
et al.170 and Park et al.171 reported the use of cysteine
protease SpeB and proteases from Group A Streptococ-
for the bioﬁlm
cus and P. aeruginosa, respectively,
dispersal.

D-tyrosine leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in cell
attachment
thus, preventing the formation of bio-
ﬁlm. It also causes bioﬁlm disassembly at a very low
concentration in both B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa.
Impact of D-tyrosine on EPS production and extra-
cellular protein is concentration speciﬁc and varies
greatly in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
The concentration of extracellular proteins increased
in B. subtilis bioﬁlms and reduced in the bioﬁlms of
P. aeruginosa. Moreover, EPS production increased
when P. aeruginosa was treated with low concentra-
tion of D-tyrosine and decreased at higher concen-
trations but no change was observed in B. subtilis.172
Hence, it is very crucial to decide the dosage care-
fully before recommending D-tyrosine for treatment
of bioﬁlms. In-vitro studies also suggested that D-
histidine, D-cysteine and D-tryptophan inhibit 35–
86% bioﬁlm formation in A. baumannii at a very
low concentration of 2 mM and D-cystine, D-trypto-
phan and D-tyrosine inhibit 10–30% bioﬁlm forma-
tion in P. aeruginosa at 4 mM. However, it is also
demonstrated in this study that signiﬁcant effects of
D-amino acids were not observed in-vivo as the
effective in-vitro concentration produced toxic effects
and even fatal when tested on mouse models. The
use of D-amino acids with antibiotics should be fur-
ther investigated.173 Some recent in-vitro and ex-vivo
studies suggested nagZ, a protein involved in pepti-
doglycan recycling, also reduces preformed bioﬁlm
in Neisseria gonorrhoeae but the exact mechanism of
bioﬁlm dispersal is still unclear.174

A lichen secondary metabolite, usnic acid (Fig. 4),
has the potential to inhibit 65% bioﬁlm formation
and yeast to hyphal transition. This compound not
only prevents adhesion but also reduces various sug-
ars in EPS. Light microscopic studies revealed that
usnic acid stops the transition from yeast to hyphal
state thereby reducing the thickness of matured bio-
ﬁlm.175 Some other reports also suggested that usnic
acid show inhibitory effect on the S. aureus bioﬁlm
and affected the morphology of bioﬁlm produced by
P. aeruginosa. Researchers have hypothesized that
this may be due to any interference in quorum sens-
ing, but
still
unclear.132

the exact mechanism of action is

In some recent studies, ethyl pyruvate (EP), an anti-
tumor and anti-trypanosome drug, has been reported to
possess signiﬁcant antimicrobial and anti-bioﬁlm activ-
ity. The architecture of the bioﬁlm matrix is especially
stabilized by DNA and negatively charged polymeric
sugars, bridged by Ca2C
ions. EP acts as a potential Ca2C
ions chelating agent due to its dicarbonyl structure,
which destabilizes the bioﬁlm matrix. Moreover, this
speciﬁc structural element plays a crucial role in inhibit-
ing enzymes pyruvate kinase of glycolytic and glyoxa-
lase-1 of para-glycolytic pathway. This explains the
antimicrobial activity of EP. The study reveals EP to be
better anti-bioﬁlm agent
for being tissue protective,
showing no side-effects in clinical studies, harmless to
symbionts, inhibiting a broad spectrum target such as
lower chance of
bacteria, fungi, parasites and mold,
developing resistance, inhibiting adhesion and matura-
tion of bioﬁlm and the dissolution of pre-formed bioﬁlm
matrix.77

Neutralization or disassembly of
lipopolysaccharides

The antimicrobial peptide (AMP) is an alternative of
conventional antibiotics and is considered as an effec-
tive anti-bioﬁlm agent. AMPs are evolutionary con-
and
served proteins with low molecular weight
exhibits antimicrobial activity against fungi, bacteria
and viruses. They are generally positively charged and
contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
sides
which make them capable of penetrating the lipid
bilayer as well as solubilizing in aquatic environ-
ment.176 Antimicrobial peptides usually bind electro-
statically with lipopolysaccharides
involving
interaction between 2 cationic amino acids (lysine
and arginine) and their respective head groups. The
complex is stabilized through hydrophobic interac-
tions between the hydrophobic amino acids of the
chains of LPS177,178 and
peptide and fatty acyl

(LPS)

peptide
Despite being a cationic peptide,
its activity is not
affected by acidic pH, negatively charged extracellular
polysaccharides in bioﬁlm matrix or high metal ion
concentrations. Rather it is capable of entering deep
in the bioﬁlm and kill bacteria very efﬁciently.179 Pol-
ymyxins, especially polymixin E or colistin and poly-
mixin B (Fig. 5) (pentabasic decapeptide antibiotic)
bind to lipid A of LPS in Gram-negative bacteria
making the outer membrane permeabilized. Along
with this, Gramicidin S (Fig. 5) also disturbs the
membrane integrity of the Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria. Both these cationic cyclic peptides
possess speciﬁc targets in cell membrane leading to
interference in the hydrophobic interactions at ligand
binding sites of the enzymes. Further improvement of
toxicity, structural analysis and clinical tests should
be performed for using it clinically.180 Likewise, sushi
peptides, a derivative of Factor C (Fig. 5) (LPS-sensi-
tive serine protease of the horseshoe crab coagulation
cascade) follow detergent-like mechanism for the dis-
ruption of LPS aggregates. They have LPS-neutraliz-
ing activity too. They act very speciﬁcally with
palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG). Unsat-
urated POPG renders ﬂuidity and ultimately increases
the entry of peptides in lipid bilayer, completely dis-
rupting membrane stability.177,181

Alteration of membrane potential or membrane

meabilization is yet another mode of action of antimicro-

The lantibiotics are the class of the peptide antibi-
otics with ring structure, linked via thioester contain-
ing lanthionine and methylanthionine, or unsaturated
amino acids dehydro alanine or 2-amino isobutyric
acids. They are synthesized by ribosomes and modi-
ﬁed post-translationally in Gram-negative bacteria
and serve as anti-bioﬁlm agents. These peptides com-
prises of an intra-molecular ring structure and can
inhibit a wide-range of bacteria.186 These compounds
pose an inhibitory effect on bacteria by damaging its
bacterial membrane thus, inhibiting the production of
enzymes. The most well known lantibiotic, nisin
(Fig. 6),
forms complex with lipid I and II thus,
resulting in the inhibition of the cell wall biosynthe-
sis.187,188 Nisin can also induce permeability to the
cytoplasmic membrane by producing pores with short
life-span.186 Subtilin (Fig. 6), another pore-forming
lantibiotic structurally similar to nisin, acts by dissi-
pating the transmembrane proton motive force result-
ing in the
from
Staphylococcus simulans and B. subtilis cells and from
to bactoprenyl
membrane vesicles. Subtilin binds
pyrophosphate and causes membrane permeabiliza-
tion in a lipid II-dependent fashion. In-vitro modiﬁca-
tions were successfully used to insert thioester rings
in various biologically active peptides. Clinical use of
these modiﬁed lantibiotics
ensured after
proper in-vivo tests.189 Epidermin and gallidermin
have the same putative lipid II binding motif as nisin;
however, differing only in size with 22 amino acids,
as compared with 34 in nisin. These 2 lantibiotics

gallidermin efﬁciently inhibits bioﬁlm formation by

However, the effect of gallidermin on mature (24-h
and 5-day-old) bioﬁlm was signiﬁcantly reduced.190

involved in bioﬁlm formation,

Biosurfactants are amphipathic molecules that possess
antibacterial activity, inhibit bacterial cell-surface adhe-
sion and hence disrupt bioﬁlm. Sophorolipids are a class
of biosurfactants that act against bioﬁlms by increasing
the permeability of membrane. In B. subtilis, sophoroli-
pids (Fig. 6) disrupt the bacterial cells followed by release
of an intracellular enzyme, malate dehydrogenase caus-
ing efﬂux of their cytoplasmic contents. They also inhibit
bioﬁlm produced by single as well as mixed culture of B.
subtilis and S. aureus at very low concentration. This
result indicated the use of sophorolipids as an adjuvant
with other antibacterial agents that
inhibit bacterial
growth or disassemble the bioﬁlm of some pathogens.191
Bioﬁlm can also be destroyed by the use of polyhexa-
methylene biguanide (Fig. 6); a cationic antimicrobial
agent disrupts the membrane and hampers the cell per-
meability without cell wall lysis. Chlorhexidine (Fig. 6)
changes the osmolarity of the cell by binding with the
negatively charged component. Compared to these 2, a
silver compound penta-silver hexaoxoiodate (Ag(5)IO
(6)) is much more efﬁcient in killing of a broad spectrum
planktonic organisms, inhibition of microbial adhesion
to surface for longer time period and disassemble and
eradicate mature bioﬁlms of C. albicans, P. aeruginosa,
and S. aureus. The reason behind the high efﬁciency may
be due to structure of the nanomaterial, which possess
silver in both cation and anion along with the protection
of anion by iodate. This compound may consider to be
used as a potent antimicrobial agent for disinfecting
medical devices like catheters, implants, ventilators and
wound dressing.192

Inhibition of cell division and survival

Cell division is very crucial for the survival of bacteria in
bioﬁlm and their further spread to a new area. Silver
accumulates within the intracellular vacuoles resulting in
the damage of plasma membrane followed by alteration
in the electric potential, thereby preventing cell divi-
sion.122,193 Some antimicrobial peptides function by
inhibiting cytoplasmic proteins, which have role in cell
division and survival. These peptides penetrate into the
cytosol of bacteria either by ﬂip-ﬂop method or channel
formation in the outer membrane protein. Some antibac-
terial peptides are rich in proline such as pyrrhocoricin
(Fig. 7),194 apidaecin195 and drosocin.196 All
these

VIRULENCE

peptides are capable to bind with multi-helical lid region
of DnaK (a heat shock protein of bacteria) and interfere
in the initiation step of chromosomal DNA replication.
Moreover, they also interfere in the interaction of DnaK
with DnaJ that causes bacterial death. Pyrrhocoricin
enters into bacterial cytosol via C-terminus and the N-
terminus is responsible for inhibition of ATPase activity
of DnaK protein.194 In addition to this, proline-rich
AMPs actively enter the bacterial cell and interfering in
translation initiation via binding to the tunnel of ribo-
some.197 Microcin B17 (Fig. 7), a ribosomally synthesized
antimicrobial peptide from Enterobacteriaceae inhibits
DNA gyrase followed by inhibition of DNA replication.
Also, it is the ﬁrst peptide that has the capability to
inhibit a type II DNA topoisomerase.198 Apart from this,
chelating agents like EDTA (Fig. 7) are able to potentiate
the cell wall, thereafter destabilizing the bioﬁlms via
sequestering iron, zinc, magnesium, and calcium. This
makes them suitable for the management of bioﬁlms.199
Chitosan, a natural polymer, due to its cationic nature
has the capability to disrupt negatively charged cell
membranes as soon as microbes settle on the surface.200

Another peptide, indolicidin, permeabilizes the mem-
brane without causing the lysis of bacterial cells. It
also inhibits DNA synthesis,203 and exhibits binding
speciﬁcity with DNA rather than RNA.204 Studies also
reported that a cationic peptide LL-37 (Fig. 8) is pres-
ent in human as host defense peptide, has the capac-
ity to reduce the bacterial adhesion and promote
stimulation of twitching motility mediated by type IV
pili. It also stimulates the downregulation of genes
related to quorum sensing.39
It was found active
against S. epidermidis inhibiting the attachment of
bacteria and thereby the formation of bioﬁlms.205
Studies also revealed that citropin (from green tree
frog Litoria citropa)206 and melimine (a non-hemo-
lytic hybrid peptide)207 have potent s activities against
P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and did not pose any
toxic effect when tested in animal models. These mol-
ecules can be used to prevent bacterial adhesion on
medical equipments like catheters and contact lenses.

binds with the cytoplasmic membrane proteins fol-
lowed by its penetration into the bacterial cell leading
to the inhibition of protein synthesis and the disrup-
tion of lipid membrane as well as it interferes with
the functioning of nucleic acids.193 Recent studies also
demonstrate the ability of AMP to coat the bacteria
the biomaterials leading to the
or the surface of
reduction of adhesion by bacteria as well as reduced
bioﬁlm formation.208 Bacteriocins like bovicin HC5
(produced by Streptococcus bovis HC5) and nisin are
found to alter the hydrophobicity of the surfaces of S.
aureus attachment, thus minimizing the adhesion to
surfaces of food items, which is thought to be a better
option than eradication of the already established bio-
ﬁlms. This facilitates long time storage and preserva-
tion of packaged food items.209 The pili or ﬁmbriae

bacteria to adhere to the host tissues and are also
found to be involved in bioﬁlm formation. PilB and

PilA components of pili are important for bioﬁlm for-
mation but not PilC.210 Pili are classiﬁed into 2
groups. Type I pili comprises of mainly 2 compo-
nents- FimA (major part) and FimH (minor part).
FimH is a mannose-binding adhesion component

which facilitates bacterial
uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) possess type I
pili attached with FimH adhesin that facilitates colo-
nization on silicone implants and on surface of uri-
nary bladder leading to CAUTI (Catheter Associated

Urinary Tract
entering the host cells bypasses the host immune sys-
tem and starts aggregating to form large intracellular
bacterial communities (IBC) similar to bioﬁlms.213-215

saliva, named lactoferrin,
inhibits the attachment of
S. mutans and Streptococcus gordonii and prevents the

lactoferrin prevents the bioﬁlm formation by Porphyr-
omonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia in the
subgingival plaque at a very low concentration of (cid:2)
8 mg/mL.217 Mannosides are small molecules that
work as an inhibitor of FimH by blocking their func-
tions.218-220 Murine model was used to investigate the
effect of mannosides for treating CAUTI and it was
found that the compound effectively inhibited inva-
sion and colonization on the urinary bladder epithe-
lium after
the implanted
bladders. It also enhanced the activity of trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole when administered orally for
the treatment of urinary tract infections.66 Addition-
ally, mannosides inhibited formation of bioﬁlm on sil-
icone surface in-vitro and if it is used for treatment in
humans, it resulted in the reduction of CAUTI rates
via inhibiting colonization and invasion of UPEC in
bladder and also by not letting to form bioﬁlm on
the catheter surface.221 Another study shows that pili-
cides,
inhibitor of Chaperone/Usher Pathway pili
inhibit type I piliation and dysregulates virulence fac-
tors of UPEC thus affecting its growth.222 Both these
molecules are of much clinical relevance and if used
to treat UTI or CAUTI current guidelines must be
followed. Mannosides may also be used along with
other potential antibacterial agents or other preven-
tive compounds before inserting catheter in patient’s
body as a preventive measure.223 In addition to these,
a plant derived compound, eugenol
is suggested to
inhibit early bioﬁlm formation and also reduce pre-
formed bioﬁlm of S. mutans. It does not affect the
bacterial viability, but downregulates the expression
of virulence genes involved in the adhesion and for-
mation of bioﬁlm such as comDE, ftf, smu630, vicR,
gtfB, relA, gbpB, gtfC, brpA, and spaPat sub-MIC
level.141

Inhibition of bioﬁlm by polysaccharides

Extracellular polysachharides is an essential compo-
nent of bioﬁlms. Recently, a few exo-polysaccharides
have been found to show negative activity against bio-
ﬁlm formation. They not only inhibit the bioﬁlm for-
mation224,225 but can also lead to the dispersion of
the preformed bioﬁlm. A recent experiment have
reported an exo-polysaccharide EPS273, obtained
from a marine bacterium, P. stutzeri 273 that reduces
bioﬁlm formation in P. aeruginosa by targeting
virulence factors which include exoprotease, pyocya-
nin, and rhamnose. EPS273 interferes with pyocyanin
production whose reduction causes the decrease in
the production of H2O2 ultimately inhibiting the
release of eDNA which is required for the formation

of stable bioﬁlms.226 It is also reported that this mole-
cule reduces bioﬁlm related infection in lung cells and
embryos of zebraﬁsh and also acts as a potent antiox-
idant,
thereby decreasing the hydroxy radicals and
superoxide radicals. Therefore, EPS273 can ﬁnd its
use in healthcare as well as in food industry against
P. aeruginosa, which is responsible for causing noso-
comial
food respectably.
Structural studies revealed that EPS273 has typical
characteristics of polysaccharide. 35.4% glucosamine,
28.6% rhamnose, 27.2% glucose, and 8.7% mannose
are the predominant monosaccharide units found in
EPS273. Molecular weight of
this molecule was
reported to be 190kDa via HPGPC analysis.227 Other
various anti-bioﬁlm polysaccharides have also been
reported. Psl and Pel (Fig. 9) from P. aeruginosa
PAO1 decrease the ability to form bioﬁlm by S. epi-
in dual-species bioﬁlm in-vitro
condi-
dermidis
tions.228,229 K2 polysaccharide
from the
capsule of E. coli and PAM galactan from strains of
K. kingae regulate their own bioﬁlm architecture like
forming water channels or dispersal of the bioﬁlm
thereby inhibiting their own bioﬁlm according to
their surrounding environment.230,231 Another poly-
saccharide, A101 from V. cholerae QY101 causes dis-
persal of the bioﬁlm formed by P. aeruginosa.224 An
exopolysaccharide, PAM galactan from the bioﬁlm of
K. kingae has also been reported to disperse bioﬁlm
of S. epidermidis.230 Many non-bacterial polysacchar-
ides extracted from plant, animal and some algae are
also reported to possess anti-bioﬁlm activity.225 These
anti-bioﬁlm polysaccharides, especially the ones that
are of bacterial origin portray broad-spectrum anti-
bioﬁlm activity while only some are capable of dis-
persing bioﬁlms in their initial stages before attaining
maturity. Different oligosaccharides or polysacchar-
ides exhibiting anti-bioﬁlm properties can be used in
settings which are greatly
industrial and clinical
inhabited by antibiotic resistant bioﬁlms causing vari-
ety of nosocomial
infections. They can be used as
adjuvant with available antibiotics reducing their min-
imum bioﬁlm eradication concentration,224 anti-adhe-
sive coating decreasing chances of infections related
to medical devices,230-233 and probiotics to deliver
saccharide prebiotics.234 Another protein PslG pro-
duced by P. aeruginosa, participates in biosynthesis of
Psl, one of the most important polysaccharide of its
bioﬁlm matrix. Structural analysis of PslG revealed
that it is an endoglycosidase and according to reports
endogenous administration of PslG disperses pre-
formed matured bioﬁlm and inhibits bioﬁlm forma-
in the matrix. Ex-vivo
tion by targeting the Psl

increases the susceptibility of bioﬁlms toward antimi-
crobials and host immune system.235

Inhibition of c-di-GMP signaling system

Bacteria exist in 3 distinct forms namely; planktonic state
responsible for acute infections and can be easily
eradicated by administration of required dosage of anti-
biotics, bioﬁlm state responsible for chronic infections
and difﬁcult to treat with antibiotics. The third form is
the dispersed state, a distinct stage during transition
between bioﬁlm and planktonic state. The process of dis-
persal facilitates bioﬁlm to spread infections within the
host and also result in the transmission of bacteria
between different hosts. Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a
secondary messenger that play role in the bioﬁlm forma-
tion. Modiﬁcation of signaling pathways of c-di-GMP in
bacteria can alter the bioﬁlm formation and its dispersal
in clinical environment.236 Under stress conditions such
as starvation, nitrosative conditions, etc., the bacterial
cells lower the amount of c-di-GMP by the activation of
phosphodiesterase leading to the dispersal of bioﬁlm.
This study also showed that bioﬁlm-dispersed cells are
very distinct from bioﬁlm as well as planktonic cells in
physiology as well as in their capacity of pathogenesis.
Dispersed cells are found to be more virulent against C.
elegans and immune cells, due to high level expression of

virulence related genes as compared with bioﬁlm and
planktonic cells. In addition to reduced c-di-GMP con-
the bioﬁlm-dispersed cells experience a
centration,
reduced rsmY and rsmZ expression resulting in low side-
rophore production by bacterial species.237 The sidero-
phores function by chelating iron from the environment
and are found to be involved in the prevention of bioﬁlm
formation by reducing the survival of dispersed cells. On
administration of chemicals, the dispersal based anti-bio-
ﬁlm activity gets induced. These dispersed cells can
phagocytosis,
escape
therefore along with the dispersing agents; administra-
tion of some antimicrobial agent is preferred, as it would
hinder the growth and the spread of dispersed cells. The
addition of an iron chelator with the dispersing agent
and antimicrobial agent would possibly eradicate the
bioﬁlm.237

the macrophage-mediated

LP 3134, LP 3145, LP 4010 and LP 1062 are the small
molecules that inhibit diguanylate cyclase (DGC) that
mediates the synthesis of c-di-GMP and hence inhibit
bioﬁlm formation in P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter
baumannii. All of these molecules have been reported to
inhibit the bioﬁlm dispersal of P. aeruginosa. Among
these, only 2 were potential candidates for inhibiting bio-
ﬁlms because they were non-toxic to eukaryotic cells.6,238
Some other molecules were also identiﬁed as inhibi-
tors of the allosteric binding of c-di-GMP, from studies

assay. DGC activity was reduced by the administration
of a synthetic organoselenium drug, ebselen, and binding
of c-di-GMP was inhibited by ebselen oxide. Therefore,
these 2 molcules can regulate the production of bioﬁlm
in P. aeruginosa.239 Indole signaling is considered as one
of the most important signaling pathway that is responsi-
ble for various pathogenicity related bacterial behaviors
such as virulence,240 acid tolerance,241 bioﬁlm forma-
tion,242 resistance to antibiotics.243 Studies performed by
Bunders et al. revealed that derivatives of desformylﬂus-
tra bromine (dFBr) result in the inhibition of production
of bioﬁlm via modulating the signaling pathway of indole
in S. aureus and E. coli.244

to be discovered. Secondary metabolites ﬁsetin
yet

bioﬁlm. Esculetin treatment affects the structural mat-
uration of bioﬁlm thereby, reducing its thickness. In
contrast to this, ﬁsetin not only reduces thickness of
mature bioﬁlm but also, interferes with the initiation
of bioﬁlm formation,
reducing the coverage area.
Hence, ﬁsetin is considered better antibioﬁlm agent
than esculetin.245 A positively charged bispyridin-
amine, octenidine hydrochloride (Fig. 10) is also sug-
gested to be an effective anti-bioﬁlm agent but its
mode of action is still unclear. Studies demonstrate
that this compound can be potentially used as sani-
lock solution in both treat-
tizer and antimicrobial
ment and prophylactic activities.246

Cytotoxicity of Anti-Bioﬁlm molecules

Cytotoxicity is the most important factor for assessing
any adverse effect of the anti-bioﬁlm molecules before
using them commercially for the prevention and removal
of bioﬁlm. Various methods are there for
testing

cytotoxic effect namely Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
assay, MTT assay, XTT assay, Trypan blue, crystal violet,
colony formation method, DAPI and PI. Naturally
derived compounds from plants are usually not toxic.
Cytotoxicity studies have been performed in a variety of
species, and the results demonstrate that octenidine
hydrochloride is not absorbed through the gastrointesti-
nal tract and, mucous membrane with no reported geno-
toxicity, carcinogenicity, or mutagenicity.247 Likewise, it
has been observed that usnic acid might show little side
effects such as allergic contact dermatitis and local irrita-
tion. In-vitro studies revealed no cytotoxic effects of this
compound when tested alone or as a constituent of oral
formulation. Moreover no toxic effects were evident in
pharmacokinetic studies as well as after oral administra-
tion.132,175 Studies also suggested that AMPs do not
show any cytotoxic effects.248 Similarly, many antibioﬁlm
compounds like S-phenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide and its
derivative diphenyl disulﬁde (inhibits bioﬁlm via quo-
rum sensing inhibition) was reported to be non-toxic
and non-lethal when tested in drosophila-based infection
models.249 Apart from testing cytotoxicity of anti-bioﬁlm
molecules, some other studies are also required such as
permeability studies, plasma protein binding, efﬂux stud-
ies and solubility (in water and salt) studies.

Conclusions and future prospective

Till date, a lot has already been studied and understood
about the bacterial bioﬁlm formation. Emergence of
severe bioﬁlm infections and its resistance to antimicro-
bial treatment, has posed a great challenge in the medical
ﬁeld. The occurrence of resistant bacteria is mainly seen
in human, farm animals, fruits, vegetables, dairy prod-
ucts, sea-foods and poultry products. Hence it is essential
to investigate the effective ways to combat this problem
and ﬁnd an alternative among antibiotics. To make
through this great challenge of today, bioﬁlm imaging
techniques have immensely developed. Fluorescence

and
reconstruction microscopy
(STORM)250-252 are the techniques which involves
super-resolution microscopy. They use ﬂuorescent pro-
teins or probes to produce images with much higher res-
olution than CSLM. Hence, these techniques can be used
more often for studying bioﬁlm. To ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
and effective alternative against bioﬁlm, focus on the dis-
covery of different anti-bioﬁlm molecules along with
modiﬁcations
signaling pathways
associated with quorum sensing is taken under consider-
ation. The higher eukaryotes are devoid of cyclic-di-
GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling pathway, which makes it an
attractive target for designing naive anti-bioﬁlm agents.
Besides these, the role of amyloids in bacterial bioﬁlms
has also become prevalent. Targeting these amyloids less-
ens the adherence property of bacterial cells hence affect-
ing the formation of bioﬁlms.6 The present study
provides the information of the mechanism of action
used by different small molecules with anti-bioﬁlm prop-
erties. Though, every anti-bioﬁlm molecules have their
speciﬁc modes of action, but a single molecule may fol-
low more than one mechanism; for example, EGCG
works either by inhibiting the AHL-mediated quorum
sensing pathway or by degradation of peptidoglycan and
membrane disruption. Information regarding mecha-
nism of action provides better understanding about the
nature of bioﬁlms, which can be further used to develop
new and successful drug molecules with the previously
known target of action. This can bring about improve-
ment in the efﬁcacy of the previously known drugs. It
can be achieved either by making suitable modiﬁcations
or by using combinatorial therapy which includes the
previously reported less effective drug against bacterial
infections along with the potent anti-bioﬁlm agents
thereby raising the activity of the antibiotics. According
to the present review, EPS273, mannosides and pilicides
are the most signiﬁcant anti-bioﬁlm agents with high
clinical relevance but needs further in-vivo testing fol-
lowed by clinical trials. The naturally derived antimicro-
bials have more biochemical and structural diversity
compared with synthetic drugs, thus could be very useful
in developing various alternative therapies and in-silico
pharmaceutical approaches. Additionally, the high com-
plexity of natural products allows enhanced selective
binding to the target. The disadvantage of using naturally
derived anti-bioﬁlm agents is their high cost, less sustain-
ability; more time consumption and sometimes they
show different results once extracted from their sources.
In contrary, synthetic drugs are cost effective and con-
sume less time but many of them show adverse side
effects. Moreover numerous peptides and polysacchar-
ides due to their large size become inappropriate from a
drug perspective. While designing any compound for

remodeling

combating bioﬁlm, it is very important to observe its
proper delivery in any in-vivo system at a particular site
and the dosage of the anti-bioﬁlm compound is another
crucial factor, which needs thorough investigation. How-
ever, the discovery of new drugs against new targets is
likely to be a prolonged and disconcerting process.
the previously used drugs
Therefore,
approved against target other than bioﬁlms may prove to
be a more appropriate and constructive idea. A wide
range of bioinformatic tools are available that might be
used for the purpose of screening libraries of the existing
drugs and to revamp them as a worthwhile contribution.
Further, research has to be performed to ﬁnd out the
small active fragments of these peptides and polysacchar-
ides that can effectively bind to the new identiﬁed targets.
