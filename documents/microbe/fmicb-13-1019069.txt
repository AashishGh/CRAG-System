Plants are constantly exposed to diverse microbes and thus develop a
sophisticated perceive system to distinguish non-self from self and identify
non-self as friends or foes. Plants can detect microbes in apoplast via
recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface to activate appropriate
signaling in response to microbes. MAMPs are highly conserved but essential
molecules of microbes and often buried in microbes’ complex structure.
Mature MAMPs are released from microbes by invasion-induced hydrolytic
enzymes in apoplast and accumulate in proximity of plasma membrane-
localized PRRs to be perceived as ligands to activate downstream signaling.
In response, microbes developed strategies to counteract these processing.
Here, we review how the form, the concentration, and the size of mature
MAMPs affect the PRR-mediated immune signaling. In particular, we describe
some potential applications and explore potential open questions in the ﬁelds.

Introduction

One of the most important evolutionary events in the history of life on earth is
advent of the earliest land plants around 480 million years ago (Gehrig et al., 1996).
During their establishment in terrestrial ecosystems, land plants have to adapt to
an environment that houses a large variety of microbes such as fungi, oomycetes,
bacteria, and viruses. From then on, if not earlier, plants and microbes have had
continual interactions, inﬂuencing the evolution of both plants and microbes (Wang
et al., 2010). To respond appropriately to such diverse microbes, plants have evolved
abilities to distinguish self from non-self (Medzhitov and JanewayJr., 2002) and
further identify non-self as friends or foes (Antolin-Llovera et al., 2014) through a
sophisticated immune system. With these distinctions and identiﬁcations, plants can
adapt to their environment by either activating immune responses to defend against
pathogens or initiating symbiosis signaling to facilitate the accommodation of symbionts
(Antolin-Llovera et al., 2014).

When microbes enter the apoplast through nature entries or
wounded sites of plants, plants can detect microbes in apoplast
via the recognition of Microbe/Pathogen-Associated Molecular
Patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs; hereafter, referred to as MAMPs)
by plant cell-surface localized Pattern Recognition Receptors
(PRRs) (Macho and Zipfel, 2014) and activate appropriate
downstream responses. The major classes of MAMPs include
proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids, with common
features: highly conserved structures, important functions for
microbe survival and absence from the host plants (Nurnberger
et al., 2004; Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017; Buscaill and van der
Hoorn, 2021).

Plant PRRs are receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or receptor-like
proteins (RLPs) that carry the extracellular leucine-rich repeat
(LRR) or lysine motif (LysM) domain to confer the recognition
of MAMPs (Buscaill and van der Hoorn, 2021). These MAMPs
serve as the ligands for PRRs, while the binding speciﬁcity of
ligand-receptor pairs is determined by both ligands (Felix et al.,
1999) and PRR receptors (Gomez-Gomez and Boller, 2000).
Such binding often induces the oligomerization of receptors
(Liu et al., 2012) and their interaction with co-receptors, which
is often required for the subsequent signal transduction (Shan
et al., 2008; Liebrand et al., 2013). In addition to these typical
MAMPs, some MAMPs (such as cerebroside) do not need a
short ligand for recognizing (Koga et al., 1998). In general,
eﬀective physiological concentrations of ligands are required for
their biological activities in plants (Albert et al., 2015).

The recognition of MAMPs by PRRs depends on both sides
of MAMPs and PRRs; here we only focus on the MAMPs side
to discuss how the form, the concentrations and the size of the
MAMPs aﬀect their recognitions and thus subsequent immune
responses in host plants.

Apoplast

In higher plants, nearly all cells are connected directly or
indirectly by plasmodesmata into a single “organism” named
as symplast and the space outside this symplast is known as
apoplast, including the cell wall and the aqueous intercellular
space (Erickson, 1986).

In the scenario of plant-microbe interactions, the apoplast
is the extracellular space in plant tissue that constitutes a
inhabitants
source of nutrients and shelter for microbial
(Sattelmacher, 2001). Meanwhile, the apoplast is a hostile
environment that contains hydrolytic enzymes and toxins for
microbes (Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2015). Thus, the apoplast is
deﬁned as compartments of intracellular space beyond the plant
plasma membrane, including the cell wall and structures that
are formed during plant-microbe interactions (Figure 1). For
example, fungal invasion forms a specialized structure known
as appressorium. Further, invasive hyphae or haustoria are
surrounded by a host-derived specialized membrane outside the

invasive structure, known as the extrainvasive hyphal membrane
(EIHM) (Kankanala et al., 2007), extrahaustorial membrane
(EHM) (Karasov et al., 2017), or periarbuscular membrane
(PAM) (Ivanov et al., 2019). The space between the microbe
plasma membrane and the host extended membrane is also part
of the apoplast (Wang et al., 2020; Figure 1).

Apoplast is a place where MAMPs matured from microbial
complex. Apoplast constitutes a major battleground for plant-
microbe interactions. Plants perceive microbial pattern via PRRs
in apoplast to activate immune responses described as pattern-
triggered immunity (PTI) (Saijo et al., 2018) while microbes
develop extracellular strategies to avoid patterns recognition
(Buscaill and van der Hoorn, 2021). Thus, the outcome of the
apoplastic battle between plant and microbes will determine
whether plants can stop invasion of microbes during early-stage
infection.

Forms of microbe-associated
molecular patterns

Currently, the majority of known MAMPs are proteins,
carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids from bacteria, fungi, or
oomycetes (see Table 1 and recent reviews for updated MAMPs
and PRRs in Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017; Wang et al., 2020; Buscaill
and van der Hoorn, 2021). Plant PRRs can perceive multiple
MAMPs that are derived from ﬂagellin, elongation factor Tu,
peptidoglycans and lipopolysaccharides in bacteria, chitin in
fungi, and Nep1-like Protein in oomycetes (Zipfel, 2014; Albert
et al., 2015; Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017).

The right form of MAMPs is necessary for the recognition
by PRRs and eﬀective activation of immune responses in plants.
The PRRs can recognize and bind with the small epitopes of
MAMPs as ligands. For a certain host PRR, the speciﬁcity and
aﬃnity of ligand binding to the PRR depends on the proper
form of MAMP, such as its sequence variants and modiﬁcations
(Nurnberger et al., 1994; Chinchilla et al., 2006).

Microbe-associated molecular
patterns variants

Microbe-associated molecular patterns are highly conserved
patterns in microbes and maintain essential function for the
microbe’s survival and therefore diﬃcult to alter (Janeway, 1989;
Medzhitov, 2007). Flg22 is one of the well-studied MAMPs
derived from the bacterial ﬂagellin (Felix et al., 1999; Zipfel
et al., 2004). Flg22 is a highly conserved 22-amino acid of the
N-terminal domain of bacterial ﬂagellin (Table 1; Felix et al.,
1999; Zipfel et al., 2004), and can be recognized by Flagellin
Sensing 2 (FLS2) (Gomez-Gomez and Boller, 2000) to trigger
immune responses.

However, some microbes can avoid the detection by PRRs
through mutating sequence of MAMPs. Mutations in ﬂg22
that are not recognized by FLS2 was reported in some
ﬂagellated bacteria (Cheng et al., 2021). An α-proteobacterium
Agrobacterium carrying a ﬂg22 variant does not trigger FLS2-
mediated immune responses (Felix et al., 1999). With diﬀerent
versions of the ﬂg22, some strains of the bacterial Ralstonia
solanacearum and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris
render them undetectable for FLS2-mediated immune system
in host plants (Pfund et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2006). Likely,
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and pv. oryzicola (Xoc)
can escape FLS2-mediated detection in rice due to substitutions
in ﬂg22 sequence (Wang et al., 2015). Further, X. arboricola pv.
juglandis with the conserved ﬂg22 sequence is non-pathogenic
but strains with mutation within the ﬂg22 sequence that
can evade the recognition by FLS2 is pathogenic (Cesbron

et al., 2015). The speciﬁc recognition of MAMPs relies on
the interaction between the extracellular domain of PRRs
and MAMPs, while the induction of immune responses in
plant cells is determined by the activation of the intracellular
domain of PRRs, the kinase domain. Interestingly, chimeric
FLS2 receptors with partially swapped extracellular domains
between the AtFLS2 and SlFLS2, could recognize both ﬂg22 in
Arabidopsis and ﬂg15 in tomato (Mueller et al., 2012). However,
whether a single native/chimeric PRR could recognize various
MAMPs and mediate broad pathogen resistances in plants still
requires further studies.

Besides ﬂg22, elf18 is another well-studied MAMPs which
contain the ﬁrst 18 amino acids of N-terminus of the highly
conserved bacterial protein Elongation factor (Table 1; Kunze
et al., 2004), and can be recognized by the EF-Tu Receptor
(EFR) to activate defense responses (Zipfel et al., 2006).

Mutations in elf18 can also aﬀect the immune activity in plants.
The elf18 variants of X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) and
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) trigger
only 0.8–3.2% of the immune activity in comparison to that
from Agrobacterium, Ralstonia, and other Xanthomonas and
Pseudomonas strains (Lacombe et al., 2010).

Another example of MAMP with sequence variant is RaxX,
a highly conserved protein in many pathogenic Xanthomonas
species. RaxX is recognized by the rice receptor kinase XA21 to
confer resistance to most strains of Xoo (Table 1; Wang et al.,
1996; Pruitt et al., 2015; Luu et al., 2019). However, Xoo isolates
with substitutions of the Y41 residue in RaxX can avoid XA21-
mediated defense (Pruitt et al., 2015).

though MAMPs are highly conserved patterns which are
essential
for microbes. Adaptive evolutions of MAMPs in
sequences and modiﬁcations render them undetectable by PRRs
and evade immunorecognition; nine diﬀerent extracellular
strategies have been recently summarized on how microbes
avoid recognition by the host (Buscaill and van der Hoorn,
2021). In response to this, plants also evolve new versions of
PRRs which can recognize these new forms of the MAMPs
(Mueller et al., 2012).

In summary, immunogenic recognition of MAMPs by plant
PRRs, which is determined by the speciﬁcity and aﬃnity of
ligand binding to PRRs, requires the proper form of MAMPs
with right sequences and modiﬁcations.

Microbe-associated molecular
patterns modiﬁcations

Modiﬁcation of the MAMPs is another strategy to render

them undetectable by plant PRRs and avoid host resistance.

Chitin is a structural unit of the fungal cell walls (Table 1)
and chitin fragments are recognized as MAMPs by cell surface
receptor Chitin Elicitor Receptor Kinase1 (CERK1) and Chitin
Elicitor-Binding Protein (CEBiP) in plants (Kaku et al., 2006;
Miya et al., 2007; Wan et al., 2008). Deacetylating chitin
into chitosan prevents the recognition of chitin by receptors
to evade host immunity (Vander et al., 1998). For example,
fungal pathogens Verticillium dahliae and Fusarium oxysporum
f. sp. vasinfectum secrete polysaccharide deacetylase1 (PDA1)
to deacetylate chitin to prevent chitin-triggered immunity in
cotton (Gao et al., 2019). The wheat stripe rust fungus Puccinia
striiformis f. sp. tritici, the broad bean rust fungus Uromyces
fabae, and the maize anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum
graminicola also replace chitin with chitosan in their hyphae
to avoid immunity (El Gueddari et al., 2002). In addition, it
was reported that chitin deacetylases in the endophytic fungus
Pestalotiopsis sp. are induced to avoid the recognition by plants
(Cord-Landwehr et al., 2016).

Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are the major component of
the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (Table 1). LPS
consists of lipid A and an oligosaccharide core that carries
an O-polysaccharide (OPS) (Dow et al., 2000). LPS can be
sensed by plant receptor-like kinase LORE and induce immune
responses (Ranf et al., 2015). It was found that the pathogenic
bacterium Xylella fastidiosa with an O-antigen chain delays
the recognition by host plants while mutants of O-antigens
strains induce faster immune responses, suggesting that glycan
modiﬁcation of LPS may aﬀect plant immunogenic recognition
(Rapicavoli et al., 2018).

Concentration of
microbe-associated molecular
patterns

Plants recognize MAMPs in a dose-dependent manner
(Albert et al., 2015), and thus the eﬀective activation of immune
responses requires enough physiological concentration of the
proper MAMPs at the infection site. The exact physiological
concentration of MAMPs is diﬃcult
to measure due to
technique limits. However, in vitro assays showed that the
activity of MAMPs ranges from pM to nM (Table 1). We
reason the exact physiological concentration of MAMPs on
site should be lower or equal to pM level since not 100%
of exogenous MAMPs could reach to the place where PRRs
are. Upon infection, the concentration of MAMPs on site is
dynamic and depends mainly on the production of MAMPs.
It is generally known MAMPs are produced through two ways:
biosynthesis and host hydrolyzation.

Generation of microbe-associated
molecular patterns through
biosynthesis

During infection, large amounts of peptidoglycan (PGN)
building blocks are biosynthesized and some of these blocks
are steadily shed into extracytoplasmic space. For instance,
Bacillus subtilis released about 50% of its PGN in one generation
during growth (Goodell and Schwarz, 1985). It has also been
found that ﬂagellin monomers are released into the supernatant
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures (Bardoel et al., 2011).
Likewise, LPSs dropped into liquid culture when Escherichia
coli grows in vitro (Mackowiak, 1984). Upon infection, these
building blocks fallen into space surrounding cells and can serve
as MAMPs for the activation of PTI signaling. For instance,
culture supernatants from Bacillus sp. were shown to cause
immune responses through the activation of nucleotide-binding

oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD), a signaling
cascade in response to mostly either meso-diaminopimelic
acid (mDAP) containing cell wall peptides (Fujimoto and
Fukase, 2011). Pseudomonas aeruginosa aprA mutants induced
an activation of TLR5 signaling via shedding monomeric
ﬂagellin into their environment (Bardoel et al., 2011). Similarly,
growing fungal cells also shed chitin into the environment
(Bueter et al., 2013).

To reduce the immune responses in plants, microbes
downregulate the biosynthesis of MAMPs to reduce the
concentrations of MAMPs on site. It was found that the
biosynthesis of ﬂagella in Pseudomonas is downregulated by
the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (cdG) (Hickman and
Harwood, 2008). Increased cdG levels in the plant pathogen
P. syringae,
the plant opportunist P. aeruginosa and the
plant commensal Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens reduce ﬂagellin
levels, and thus reduce ﬂg22 concentration on site, which
contributes to the evasion of FLS2-mediated immune response
in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Pfeilmeier et al.,
2016). Similarly, the maize fungal pathogen C. graminicola
downregulates the expression of genes encoding KRE5 and
KRE6, which are key enzymes for the biosynthesis of β-glucan
(Oliveira-Garcia and Deising, 2016).

Generation of microbe-associated
molecular patterns through host
hydrolytic enzymes

On the other hand, host hydrolytic activities establish
decomposition of MAMPs precursors in apoplast to generate
soluble ligands for PRRs. Plant apoplast contains hundreds
of glycosidases, proteases, and other hydrolases (Grosse-Holz
et al., 2018). In general, these hydrolases in the apoplast are
not considered directly detrimental to pathogen growth, but are
presumed to release pathogen MAMPs, which in turn trigger
downstream defense responses. For example, fugal pathogens
often induce plant chitinases to target the fungal cell walls,
releasing chitin as MAMPs (Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2015). Upon
bacterial infection, plants can produce a metazoan lysozyme-like
hydrolase (LYS1), which releases soluble PGN from insoluble
bacterial cell walls for triggering plant immunity (Liu et al.,
2014). Similarly, immunogenic ﬂagellin peptides are released
from ﬂagellin by host proteases with glycosidases to trigger
immunity (Buscaill et al., 2019).

In response to host hydrolyzation, microbes can secret
proteins or glycans to protect MAMPs precursors from
hydrolases. One method is to secret proteins that cover the
hydrolytic sites in MAMP precursors. Tomato leaf mold
fungus produced Avr4 binds speciﬁcally to chitin in the fungal
cell walls to protect it from plant chitinases (van den Burg
et al., 2006). Similarly, xylem-invading fungus Verticillium
nonalfalfae prevents chitin from hydrolysis by secreting

VnaChtBP that binds chitin and suppresses chitin-induced
immunity (Volk et al., 2019). Interestingly, the fungal vascular
wilt pathogen V. dahliae strain VdLs17 could secret a lineage-
speciﬁc LysM eﬀector, Vd2LysM, which mimics the host PRR
to bind chitin and suppresses chitin-induced immune responses
(Akcapinar et al., 2015).

Glycosylation of MAMP precursors is another approach
employed by microbes to evade host recognitions. For instance,
glycosylation of bacterial ﬂagellin and fungal chitin suppress
the release of MAMPs. O-glycosylation of ﬂagellin is observed
in bacterial pathogens such as Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas,
Burkholderia, Dickeya, Erwinia, Pantoea, and Pectobacterium
(Taguchi et al., 2010; Ichinose et al., 2013; De Maayer and
Cowan, 2016), presumably preventing the hydrolytic release of
the ﬂagellin MAMP (Buscaill and van der Hoorn, 2021). While
mutants of the ﬂagellin glycosyltransferase in P. syringae pv.
tabaci 6605, P. syringae pv. glycinea race 4 and X. campestris
pv. campestris Xca showed less virulent to their host plants
(Takeuchi et al., 2003; Taguchi et al., 2006; Ichinose et al., 2013).
In bacterial pathogens Acidovorax avenae which cause rice
leaf blight, ﬂagellin from the N1141 strain but not K1 strain
induces immune responses. The ﬂagellin in two strains are
identical in sequences but diﬀerent in glycosylation pattern such
as a 1,600 Da O-glucan for N1141 while a 1,600-Da one for K1
(Hirai et al., 2011).

Glycosylation of fungal cell walls could also prevent the
release of chitin from cell wall. For instance, rice pathogens
Magnaporthe oryzae, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, and Rhizoctonia
solani accumulate α-1,3-glucan on the surface of infectious
hyphae (Fujikawa et al., 2009, 2012). While fungal mutants with
reduced α-1,3-glucan levels showed less virulence, suggesting
that α-1,3-glucan may prevent chitin release from cell wall
(Fujikawa et al., 2012).
In summary,

the
proper MAMPs, which is required for activation of eﬀective
immune responses at the infection site, is dependent on both
biosynthesis of MAMPs by microbes and hydrolytic release of
MAMPs by plants.

Size of microbe-associated
molecular patterns

In apoplast, mature MAMPs accumulate in the proximity
of the plasma membrane-localized PRRs through biosynthesis
(Mackowiak, 1984; Goodell and Schwarz, 1985; Bardoel et al.,
2011) or host hydrolytic enzymes (Guimil et al., 2005; Liu et al.,
2014; Buscaill et al., 2019). The epitopes of MAMPs serve as
ligands for PRR recognition and the immunogenic units of
MAMPs are often buried in the MAMP precursors that are
essential structures of microbes such as cell wall (Kaku et al.,
2006; Miya et al., 2007) and ﬂagella (Felix et al., 1999; Zipfel et al.,
2004).

The predicted size of the mature microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) from crystal structure of Pattern Recognition Receptor
(PRR)-ligand pairs. (A) Chitin in atCERK1, (NAG)4 = 2.07 nm; (B) Chitin in OsCEBiP, (NAG)3 = 1.54 nm; (C) ﬂg22, ﬂg22 in Flagellin Sensing 2 (FLS2)
length of ﬂg22 = 4.06 nm; (D) atPEP1 in atPEPR, length of atPep1 = 4.4 nm.

For the eﬀective MAMP-PRR recognition, ﬁrstly MAMP
molecules must be released as soluble fragments from precursors
by host hydrolytic enzymes. Then these fragments need to move
cross the host cell wall matrix before being recognized as ligands
by plant plasma membrane-localized PRRs (Figure 1).

Plant cell walls compose of cross-linked polysaccharides
with pores, ranged from 5 to 20 nm in size (Wang et al., 2016;
Cunningham et al., 2018), suggesting that any MAMPs with size
greater than these pores could be limited in their ability to pass
through the cell wall matrix. Based on these criteria, the size of
the mature MAMPs should be less than the pore size of cell wall
matrix (5 nm). The immunogenic fragments of chitin, (NAG)7–
8, can induce the highest immune activity in plants (Zipfel,
2008). Consistent with this, the length of (NAG)8 is around
4.14 and 4.08 nm (Figure 2), based on the crystal structures of
the chitin receptors atCERK1 and OsCEBiP, respectively (Liu
et al., 2012, 2016). Likewise, the length of ﬂg22 from ﬂagellin
is 4.6 nm (Figure 2; Sun et al., 2013). Further, the length of
atPep1 is 4.4 nm (Tang et al., 2015). As expected, these mature
MAMPs have a size of less than 5 nm, which allows them to
move through the cell wall matrix before speciﬁcal binding to
their PM-localized PRRs.

In summary, the size of proper MAMPs with immunogenic
activity falls in such a range that allow themselves to move
through cell wall pores, as well as to bind with PRRs and initiate
eﬀective immune signaling.

Conclusion and perspectives

During plant-microbe co-evolution, plant developed a
sophisticated system to detect pathogens in apoplast and activate
appropriate signaling in response to microbial invasions. Instead
of direct perceiving entire microbes, plant only recognizes
microbial signatures (MAMPs) by the cell surface receptors
(PRRs) to initiate immune responses. Here, we discussed the

form, the concentration, and the size of the mature MAMPs for
eﬀective activation of immune signaling in plants.

In plant apoplast, the cell wall matrix forms a barrier
between apoplastic microbes and plant plasma membrane-
localized PRRs (Figure 1). On one hand, the cell wall acts as
a physical barrier to prevent microbes from contacting directly
with plasma membrane. On the other hand, plant cell needs to
overcome this distance barrier to directly detect the invasion
of microbes to initiate immune responses. Investigation of the
size range of immunogenic MAMPs will aid to understand the
recognition and activation mechanisms of PTI, and develop new
eﬀective disease resistance strategies in plants. Furthermore,
MAMPs can trigger plants to switch to a primed state of
enhanced defense known as defense priming, which can also
be induced by synthetic chemicals (Conrath et al., 2015).
Knowledge of the size range of immunogenic MAMPs helps to
design synthetic molecules as eﬃcient priming inducers.

Recognition of MAMPs by PRRs triggers PTI which is
locally and transiently, thus the ﬁne-tuning signaling is required
for plants in responds to such diverse microbes. We described
that the PAMPs can be generated by both microbe biosynthesis
and plant hydrolytic cleavage, while the concentration of PAMPs
is temporally dynamic at the infection site of plant. In a temporal
resolution, invasion of pathogens in apoplast initially generate
low levels of MAMPs, which can be detected immediately
by PRRs to induce signaling, including the upregulation of
hydrolytic enzymes in apoplast (Liu et al., 2014). Consequently,
increased levels of hydrolytic enzymes in apoplast release
more MAMPs from pathogens and the elevated concentration
of MAMPs then trigger stronger PTI. When pathogens are
inhibited by immune responses and decreased in apoplast,
MAMP precursors decrease subsequently. As a result, high
levels of apoplastic hydrolytic enzymes over-digest the MAMPs
into small fragments,
leading to the low concentration of
immunogenic MAMPs. Small fragments can further compete
with immunogenic MAMPs for PRR binding and reduce PTI,
which in turn prevents the upregulation of hydrolytic enzymes.
Thus, the temporal dynamic of MAMPs enables plant to
respond to the invasion of pathogens in an appropriate manner.
However, it is unknown if there is a spatial regulation of MAMPs
in apoplast since there is no any separated space in apoplast.

precursors, further understandings of these apoplastic events
will ultimately lead to novel strategies to enhance pathogen
resistances in plants.
