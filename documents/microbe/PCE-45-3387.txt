Abstract

Environmental stresses can compromise the interactions of plants with beneficial

microbes.

In the present review, experimental results showing that stresses

negatively affect the abundance and/or functionality of plant beneficial microbes

are summarized.
interference of these
plant−microbe interactions is explained by the stress‐mediated induction of plant

It is proposed that the environmental

signalling pathways associated with defence hormones and reactive oxygen species.

These plant responses are recognized to regulate beneficial microbes within plants.

The direct negative effect of stresses on microbes may also contribute to the

environmental regulation of these plant mutualisms. It is also posited that, in stress

situations, beneficial microbes harbour mechanisms that contribute to maintain the

mutualistic associations. Beneficial microbes produce effector proteins and increase

the antioxidant levels in plants that counteract the detrimental effects of plant stress
responses on them. In addition, they deliver specific stress‐protective mechanisms

that assist to their plant hosts to mitigate the negative effects of stresses. Our study
contributes to understanding how environmental stresses affect plant−microbe

interactions and highlights why beneficial microbes can still deliver benefits to plants

in stressful environments.

reduced the Epichloë endophyte‐derived resistance to insects in

Lolium multiflorum plants (Ueno et al., 2016). More severe was the
effect of UV‐B radiation on Epichloë‐derived benefits. Elevated UV‐
B levels completely supressed the endophyte‐based herbivore

resistance in Festuca pratensis plants. Even worse was the effect
of UV‐A radiation on the endophyte‐based herbivore resistance.
Elevated UV‐A levels made the endophyte‐symbiotic plants more

susceptible to insect herbivores than their nonsymbiotic counter-
parts (McLeod et al., 2001). Similarly to the UV‐B radiation,

F I G U R E 1 Beneficial microbes are affected by plant stress responses. Plants are challenged by distinct abiotic and/or biotic stresses. They
perceive stresses by cell membrane receptors including receptor like kinases (e.g., BAK1). Activated receptors coordinate multiple responses in
plant cells, such as calcium (Ca2+) fluxes and phosphorylation of proteins, that stimulate the biosynthesis of signalling molecules including
hormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Pozo et al.,
2015). Hormones and ROS orchestrate signalling cascades that modulate master regulators (e.g., NPR1, JAZ, EIN3) of the expression of key
stress‐responsible transcription factors (e.g., TGA, MYC, ERF1). The activation of these transcription factors, during the processing of the stress
signalling, leads to massive transcriptome changes that modulate the phenotype of plants in response to the stress. We propose that plant
SA‐, JA‐, ET‐ and ROS‐associated stress responses can negatively affect beneficial microbes (e.g., foliar endophytes, root endophytes,
mycorrhizal fungi). This is because these responses typically are associated with production of antimicrobial proteins (e.g., glucanases, chitinases),
changes in growth of microbes within plant tissues, reinforcement of plant cell walls, oxidative stress and senescence of plant tissues
(i.e., programmed cell death). The list of molecules is focused on defence‐related hormonal and ROS signalling pathways and is not exhaustive

It is worth mentioning that environmental stresses can affect
plant−microbe interactions by mechanisms not related to plant stress

responses. For instance, environmental stresses directly inhibit the

development of beneficial microbes in soil and reduce the plant

peroxisomes and mitochondria organelles as by‐products of the

metabolism (Miller et al., 2010). These molecules are formed by
transferring electrons with high‐energy to molecular oxygen and

include hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen and superoxide radical. At

salicylic acid and jasmonic acid/ethylene plant signalling pathways

(Wang et al., 2021). Additionally, crinkler (CRN) 1 is another effector

produced by R. irregularis that control plant immune responses. While

the specific mechanism of action of CRN1 is unknown, a reduced

expression of this fungal effector decreased the size and abundance

of mycorrhizal arbuscules in roots of Medicago truncatula plants

(Voß et al., 2018).

Plant beneficial microbes also secrete effectors that counteract
ROS‐associated plant stress responses. The root endophyte S.
indica inhibited ROS‐derived plant immune responses by producing
the effector fungal glucan‐binding 1 that altered the cell wall

composition of the fungus. This remodelled cell wall would bypass

the plant recognition of the fungus, avoiding the plant production of

ROS and the associated immune response (Wawra et al., 2016).

Furthermore, beneficial microbes stimulate the formation of

antioxidants in plants that efficiently neutralize ROS (Balestrini

et al., 2018; Hamilton et al., 2012; Li et al., 2021; Noctor & Foyer,

1998). Antioxidants with major roles in plants include catalase,

flavonoids, peroxidases, proline and superoxide dismutase (Noctor

et al., 2018). For instance, the presence of Epichloë endophytes

promoted the growth of Elymus dahuricus plants under drought

which was associated with increased antioxidant contents and

reduced oxidative damage in plants (Zhang & Nan, 2007). Similarly,

endophytes of the same genus in L. perenne plants challenged by

distinct phytopathogens increased antioxidant concentrations (i.e.,

peroxidases, proline and superoxide dismutase) and decreased the

levels of oxidative damage in plants (Ma et al., 2015). The symbiosis

of Colobanthus quitensis with the beneficial root endophyte fungi

Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum triggered the

formation flavonoid antioxidants,

including quercetin, which

increased the protection of host plants against highly damaging
UV‐B radiation (Barrera et al., 2020). The increased drought
tolerance in mycorrhizal‐symbiotic S.

lycopersicum plants was

associated with enhanced concentrations of proline antioxidants

and reduced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide compounds

(Chitarra et al., 2016). In the same plant species, the presence of

F I G U R E 2 Beneficial microbes counteract plant stress responses
and protect hosts from stresses. Abiotic and biotic stresses induce
stress responses in plants that are governed by signalling molecules
including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Pozo et al.,
2015). Plant beneficial symbionts are affected directly by abiotic/
biotic stresses or indirectly by plant stress responses (i.e., SA‐, JA‐,
ET‐, ROS‐ and RNS‐associated responses). These symbionts protect
themselves from plant stress responses by the production of
antioxidants that reduce ROS‐ and RNS‐derived oxidative damage
and fungal effectors that efficiently repress defensive hormone‐ and
ROS‐associated host responses. Additionally, plant beneficial
symbionts protect from stresses by producing stress‐protective
mechanisms (e.g., antiherbivore alkaloids, osmoprotectant molecules)
and/or inducing plant tolerance/resistance mechanisms against
stresses (e.g., photosynthesis, priming of plant immune responses).
The symbionts' mechanisms that counteract plant stress responses or
protect plants from stresses are described in the main text. Arrows
indicate positive regulation and truncated lines inhibition or negative
regulation. Red connectors denote direct effects of stresses on plants
and beneficial microbes. The plant regulation of beneficial microbes is
represented with a thinner truncated line since plant stress responses
may be attenuated by the microbial production of effectors and

In the present review, several experimental results showing that
environmental stresses compromised plant−microbe interactions

were highlighted. It was proposed that this environmental interfer-
ence of plant−microbe interactions is explained by the stress‐

mediated induction of salicylic acid,

jasmonic acid, ethylene, ROS

and other signalling pathways (Figure 1). These plant signalling

are

(e.g., Kloppholz et al., 2011; Plett et al., 2014; Wawra et al., 2016).

The direct effects of stresses on microbes may also explain the
environmental interference of plant−microbe associations (Figure 2).

Further experiments manipulating plant stress responses will be
critical for determining the relative importance of direct and plant‐
mediated effects of stressors in compromising plant−microbe
