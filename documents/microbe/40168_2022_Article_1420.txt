Abstract 
Plant‑microbe interactions dynamically affect plant growth, health, and development. The mechanisms underpinning 
these associations are—to a large extent—mediated by specialized host‑derived secondary metabolites. Flavonoids 
are one of the most studied classes of such metabolites, regulating both plant development and the interaction 
with commensal microbes. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the multiple roles of flavonoids in mediat‑
ing plant‑microbe interactions. First, we briefly summarize the general aspects of flavonoid synthesis, transport, and 
exudation in plants. Then, we review the importance of flavonoids regulating plant‑microbe interactions and dynami‑
cally influencing the overall community assembly of plant‑root microbiomes. Last, we highlight potential knowledge 
gaps in our understanding of how flavonoids determine the interactions between plants and commensal microbes. 
Collectively, we advocate the importance of advancing research in this area toward innovative strategies to effectively 
manipulate plant‑microbiome composition, in this case, via flavonoid production and exudation in plant roots.

Introduction
Plant  microbiomes  greatly  affect  the  host  develop-
ment,  health,  and  ability  to  withstand  biotic  and  abiotic 
stresses  [1,  2].  The  adaptation  to  distinct  environmental 
conditions  and  responses  to  various  stresses  often  trig-
ger  terrestrial  plants  to  secrete  chemical  compounds 
through  their  root  system  into  the  surrounding  envi-
ronment  (the  rhizosphere).  These  sets  of  root  exudates/
chemicals have multiple roles in plant growth and stress 
responses,  including  the  improvement  of  the  rhizos-
phere soil chemical properties, their effects on enhancing

plant  nutrient  uptake,  and  the  recruitment  of  beneficial 
microbial taxa [3–7]. For example, amino acids and long-
chain organic acids were shown to be secreted in Arabi-
dopsis roots when plants were challenged with the foliar 
pathogen  Pseudomonas  syringae  pv.  tomato  DC3000 
(hereafter Pst. DC3000) [8]. These chemicals exhibited a 
remarkable  modulation  of  the  rhizosphere  microbiome 
in  subsequent  plant  generations,  with  an  effect  on  dis-
ease suppression [8, 9]. In fact, several products from the 
plant  secondary  metabolism  (PSM)  have  been  shown  to 
dynamically modulate the establishment of plant-associ-
ated  microbiomes  [10].  For  example,  flavonoids,  terpe-
noids, strigolactones, and coumarins—all of which affect 
plant fitness and regulate the assembly of specific micro-
bial taxa in the rhizosphere [11–14].

Flavonoids  constitute  a  major  group  of  plant-special-
ized (or secondary) metabolites broadly studied in plant 
root  exudates  [6].  The  term  “flavonoids”  commonly 
refer  to  a  group  of  compounds  that  contain  a  diphenyl 
propane   (C6-C3-C6)  backbone  in  which  two  aromatic 
rings  (A  and  B)  are  linked  through  the  central  three-
carbon chain (C ring) (Fig. 1A). To date, more than 8000

flavonoid  compounds  have  been  isolated  and  identified 
from a diverse set of plant species [15]. And, the majority 
of  these  compounds  are  allocated  within  six  major  cat-
egories,  namely  flavonols,  flavones,  isoflavones,  antho-
cyanins,  flavanones,  and  flavanols.  This  classification 
is  based  on  the  saturation  and  oxidation  of  the  C  ring 
(Fig. 1A) [15]. Within each of these categories, flavonoid 
compounds differ by specific modifications in their mol-
ecules  caused  by  the  hydroxylation,  methylation,  glyco-
sylation, or acylation of the A and B rings.

Flavonoids  are  essential  molecules  affecting  plant 
growth  and  development,  as  well  as  acting  on  plant 
defense  mechanisms  against  biotic  and  abiotic  factors 
(Fig. 1B). They are involved in the determination of pat-
terns of root growth by regulating the auxin polar trans-
portation  [16],  controlling  male  fertility  in  maize  (Zea 
mays),  petunia  (Petunia  hybrid),  tomato  (Solanum  lyco-
persicum),  and  rice  (Oryza  sativa),  by  affecting  pollen 
germination and pollen tube growth [17–20]. Moreover, 
the compound tricin, a 3′,5′-dimethoxylated flavone, was 
reported  as  one  of  the  “non-monolignol”  lignin  mono-
mers  incorporated  into  the  cell  wall  lignin  in  the  grass 
family  [21–23].  Anthocyanidins—together  with  other 
co-pigments—are  known  to  contribute  to  the  red,  pur-
ple,  and  blue  coloration  in  most  flowers,  fruits,  seeds, 
and  vegetative  tissues,  thus  attracting  pollinators  and 
influencing rates of plant seed dispersal by animals [24]. 
In  addition,  specific  compounds  from  subgroups  of  fla-
vones and isoflavones were shown to exhibit remarkable 
anti-fungal, weed-resistant, and insect-resistant activities 
in some crops [25–28]. Furthermore, mounting evidence 
suggests  flavonoids  to  also  be  involved  in  light  stress 
resistance  [29–31],  as  well  as  in  drought  stress  toler-
ance [32, 33]. However, our knowledge of how flavonoids 
mediate  plant-microbe  interactions  and  influence  the 
overall  microbiome  assembly  and  functioning  remains 
yet  partially  elusive.  In  this  review,  we  summarize  our 
current understanding of the fate of flavonoids by plants, 
as well as their roles in mediating dynamic plant-microbe 
interactions.  We  also  discuss  the  extent  to  which  flavo-
noids can impose changes in the assembly and function-
ing  of  the  root  microbiome  and  delve  into  the  detailed 
mechanisms underpinning these processes.

Biosynthesis and transport of flavonoids in plants 
and exudation
Flavonoids biosynthesis in plants

The  core  flavonoid  biosynthetic  pathway  shared  by  land 
plants  is  initiated  by  the  catalyzation  of  chalcone  syn-
thase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI). As essential 
enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, CHS 
and  CHI  are  ubiquitous  in  flavonoid-producing  plants. 
CHS and CHI are responsible for generating the middle 

C ring of the flavonoid skeleton that produces flavanones, 
such  as  naringenin  (Fig.  1A).  Flavanones  serve  as  sub-
strates for a range of downstream flavonoid biosynthetic 
enzymes,  thus  generating  a  diverse  array  of  flavonoid 
metabolites.  Depending  on  the  types  of  downstream 
enzymes,  different  flavonoid  molecules  are  formed  and 
accumulated  across  different  plant  species  (Fig.  1A).  In 
dicot plants, flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and flavonol 
synthase (FLS) are required for the synthesis of flavonols 
and their derivatives accumulation. In some plant tissues 
that  accumulate  anthocyanidin,  e.g.,  corolla  and  fruits, 
the activities of the enzymes dihydroflavonol 4-reductase 
(DFR)  and  anthocyanidin  synthase  (ANS)  are  required. 
In contrast, monocots are more prone to synthesize and 
accumulate flavones and their derivatives via flavone syn-
thase (FNS). In addition, the isoflavone synthase (IFS) is 
uniquely present in legumes, which leads to the produc-
tion of isoflavones. Besides, numerous enzymes that cata-
lyze  the  hydroxylation,  methylation,  glycosylation,  and 
acylation  of  flavonoids  have  been  identified,  which  col-
lectively contribute to the diversity of the flavonoids syn-
thesized by plants [15]. Also of key importance, flavonoid 
biosynthetic  enzymes  can  chemically  interact  with  each 
other  to  form  enzyme  complexes.  These  are  tethered  to 
the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via 
the  ER-bound  cytochrome  P450  proteins  [34]  (Fig.  1C). 
The  metabolon  formed  by  these  enzyme  complexes  is 
responsible for facilitating the channeling of the pathway 
intermediates that enhance the production of flavonoids 
[34].  Besides  the  ER,  the  tonoplast  and  nucleus  are  also 
considered the subcellular sites for flavonoid biosynthesis 
as some of the flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes are local-
ized within these cellular compartments [35, 36].

Transport of flavonoids in plants and exudation

In  plants,  flavonoids  are  transported  within  cells 
(Fig.  1C).  In  brief,  after  flavonoids  are  biosynthesized, 
these molecules are transported to vacuoles as major sites 
of storage. It is worth noticing that flavonoids can also be 
transported to other cellular compartments and even to 
the extracellular space. So far, three distinct mechanisms, 
namely  vesicle  trafficking,  membrane  transporters,  and 
glutathione-S-transferase 
transport, 
have  been  proposed  [37]  (Fig.  1C).  The  vesicle  traffick-
ing of flavonoids was previously demonstrated in Arabi-
dopsis gfs9 (green fluorescent seed) mutants, enumerating 
the  involvement  of  the  GFS9  in  membrane  trafficking 
[38].  Also,  two  major  types  of  membrane  transporters, 
namely  multidrug  and  toxin  efflux  (MATE)  transport-
ers  and  ATP-binding  cassette  (ABC)  transporters,  were 
described  to  be  involved  in  the  transport  of  flavonoids 
[39–41].  Besides,  some  studies  suggested  that  GST  is 
important for vesicle trafficking and membrane-mediated 

(GST)-mediated

transport of flavonoids [42, 43]. However, whether these 
trafficking  systems  are  associated  with  distinct  locali-
zations  of  flavonoids  in  plant  tissues  remains  still  to  be 
explored.

Some  flavonoids  are  also  released  to  the  root  exter-
nal  environment  [7,  44,  45],  i.e.,  the  plant  rhizosphere 
(Fig. 1C). The discussed intracellular mechanisms of fla-
vonoid transport and delivery are also associated with the 
release via root exudation [7]. In this scenario, the exuda-
tion of flavonoids in the rhizosphere has been proposed 
to be dynamically absorbed onto soil organic matter and/
or to be rapidly degraded by soil-dwelling microbes [46, 
47].  For  instance,  one  study  that  simulated  the  daidzein 
(an  isoflavone,  Fig.  1A)  distribution  in  the  rhizosphere 
showed  that  this  flavonoid  compound  can  only  be  dis-
tributed  a  few  millimeters  away  from  the  root  surface, 
thus indicating that the soil mobility of daidzein is poten-
tially greatly reduced by soil adsorption [48]. Given these 
interactions  with  soil  physicochemical  particles  and  as 
mediators of biotic interactions, several studies have been 
exploring the intricacies of flavonoid-mediated functions 
in the plant rhizosphere [49, 50].

Flavonoids as mediators of plant‑microbe interactions

Terrestrial  plants  are  associated  with  a  myriad  of 
microbes  establishing  beneficial,  detrimental,  or  com-
mensal interactions. These dynamic interactions between 
host  plants  and  microbes  have  strong  impacts  on  plant 
growth,  fitness,  and  even  plant-microbe  evolution  [51]. 
Flavonoids exert important roles in mediating several of 
these interactions. Perhaps, mostly known for its impor-
tance  in  the  process  of  Rhizobium  nodulation  in  plants 
belonging to the Fabaceae family [52]. However, there are 
several other mechanisms by which flavonoids determine 
the  interaction  with  other  plant-associated  microbes. 
From  this  section  on,  we  will  review  some  general  and 
specialized  roles  of  flavonoids  in  plant-microbe  interac-
tions, including pathogen, rhizobium, arbuscular mycor-
rhizal  fungi  (AMF),  and  other  plant  growth-promoting 
rhizobacteria  (PGPR).  Besides,  we  also  included  some 
examples  of  studies  focusing  on  flavonoids  as  chemi-
cal  cues  associated  with  bacterial  quorum  sensing,  thus 
mediating plant-microbe interactions.

The role of flavonoids in plant‑pathogen interaction

Several pathogen-induced flavonoid compounds are con-
sidered  phytoalexins  due  to  their  accumulation  in  plant 
tissues  upon  pathogen  infection,  in  addition  to  their 
antimicrobial  activities  (Fig.  2A).  For  example,  the  bio-
synthesis of sakuranetin (a flavanone) in rice was shown 
to  increase  the  plant  resistance  to  infection  against  (1) 
bakanae caused by Fusarium fujikuroi [53], (2) rice blast 
caused by Magnaporthe Oryzae [54], and (3) sheath blight 

caused by Rhizoctonia solani [55]. In sorghum (Sorghum 
bicolor),  the  pathogen-induced  3-deoxyanthocyanidins 
and luteolin (a flavone, Fig. 1A) exhibited remarkable tox-
icity  to  spores  of  the  fungus  Colletotrichum  sublineola, 
the  causal  agent  of  anthracnose  [56].  In  addition,  trans-
genic  sorghum  lines  (SbF3H1)  that  produce  flavonols 
and  anthocyanidins  were  shown  to  enhance  resistance 
against  C.  sublineola  [57].  Also,  metabolome  and  tran-
scriptome analyses revealed that the accumulation of fla-
vonoids  can  confer  resistance  to  Verticillium  dahliae  in 
a spontaneous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) mutant with 
red coloration [58]. Moreover, transgenic poplar (Populus 
euphratica)  overexpressing  two  transcriptional  factors, 
PalbHLH1  and  PalMYB90,  had  increased  accumulation 
of  proanthocyanidins,  anthocyanins,  and  flavonols,  that 
collectively  provided  resistance  to  infection  by  Botrytis 
cinerea and Dothiorella gregaria [59]. On the other hand, 
the reduced accumulation of flavonoids can enhance the 
susceptibility  of  transgenic  plants  to  infection  by  patho-
gens.  For  example,  MtABCG10-silenced  composite 
Medicago (Medicago truncatula) was shown to be more 
sensitive to Fusarium oxysporum, a root-infecting patho-
gen. These authors suggested that isoflavonoid transport 
by  MtABCG10  may  have  an  essential  role  in  pathogen 
defense [41]. Last, the knockdown of the transcriptional 
factor HvWRKY23 in Fusarium head blight (FHB) resist-
ant barley (Hordeum vulgare) was found to result in the 
downregulation  of  key  flavonoid  biosynthetic  genes,  as 
well as in the reduction of flavonoid accumulation, which 
collectively  resulted  in  an  increased  disease  incidence 
when  challenged  with  the  pathogen  Fusarium  gramine-
arum  [60].  In  most  of  these  examples,  the  mechanisms 
by  which  different  flavonoids  operate  as  antimicrobial 
compounds  have  been  previously  summarized  [61].  In 
brief, these include microbial membrane lysis or rupture, 
inhibition  of  biofilm  formation,  cell  envelope  synthesis, 
nucleic acid synthesis, electron transport chain, and ATP 
synthesis, etc. (see [61] for additional details).

It  is  worth  noticing  that  specific  microbial  taxa  might 
have  evolved  resistance  to  flavonoid  phytoalexins, 
thus  enabling  their  survival  and  colonization  of  plant 
hosts.  For  example,  the  MexAB-OprM  efflux  pump 
was  reported  to  mediate  the  resistance  of  Pst.  DC3000 
to  flavonoids  [62].  In  a  mutant  line  of  Pst.  DC3000 
which  lacks  the  MexAB-OprM  transporter,  flavonoids 
were  shown  to  inhibit  the  function  of  the  GacS/GacA 
two-component  system  that  affects  the  synthesis  of 
the  microbial  flagella  and  the  type  III  secretion  system 
of  Pst.  DC3000  [63].  Also,  the  multidrug  transporter 
PSPTO_0820  and  the  multidrug  resistance  efflux  pump 
outer  membrane  channel  protein  PSPTO_4977  in  Pst. 
DC3000  were  experimentally  induced  by  flavanol  cat-
echin.  Most  interestingly,  the  knockout  of  these  genes

lipo‑oligosaccharide. Flavonoids are secreted into the rhizosphere via distinct mechanisms (see “Transport of flavonoids in plants and exudation” 
section). Specific flavonoid molecules in the rhizosphere are perceived by Rhizobium, which induces the expression of the Nod gene. This gene 
expression results in the synthesis and secretion of Nod factors (LPO). Legume plants recognize these Nod factors in the receptor and via the signal 
transduction pathway, thus eliciting a series of physiological and biochemical responses. Besides, flavonoid, such as kaempferol inhibits auxin 
transport, which enhances auxin concentration in the cortical cells and accelerates cell division and growth. Together, these physiological and 
biochemical processes lead to the formation of the root nodule

directly hindered the colonization of tomato roots by the 
Pst. DC3000 mutants [64]. Moreover, the HopZ1, a type 
III  secreted  effector  of  P.  syringae,  was  found  to  physi-
cally  interact  with  2-hydroxyisoflavanone  dehydratase 
(GmHID1). This was shown to result in an inhibition of 
daidzein production, thus promoting the proliferation of 
P. syringae in soybean (Glycine max) [65]. Last, microbial 
enzymes  involved  in  the  degradation  of  flavonoids  have 
been  reported  to  confer  adaptive  abilities  to  specialized 
pathogens to bypass flavonoid phytoalexins defenses. For 
example, a quercetin dioxygenase gene (QDO) was found 
in the genomes of several pathogens. This gene encodes 
an  enzyme  able  to  catalyze  the  cleavage  of  the  flavonol 
carbon  skeleton,  which  degrades  flavonols  into  phloro-
glucinol carboxylic and phenolic acids [66, 67].

The role of flavonoids in plant‑rhizobium interaction

Flavonoids have been mostly studied with respect to their 
influence  on  rhizobium  nodulation  in  Fabaceae  plants 
(Fig. 2B). Early in vitro studies suggested that flavonoids 
serve  as  inducers  of  the  expression  of  the  rhizobia  nod 
gene  and  as  chemo-attractants  enhancing  the  concen-
tration of rhizobium on root surfaces. To illustrate these 
concepts,  the  exogenous  addition  of  isoflavones  was 
shown  to  induce  the  expression  of  nod-lacZ  fusions  in 
Bradyrhizobium  japonicum  [68].  Also,  the  imbibition  of 
alfalfa  (Medicago  sativa)  seeds  induced  the  accumula-
tion of quercetin-3-O-galactoside (a flavonol) and luteo-
lin-7-O-glucoside (a flavone), which are molecules able to 
enhance the growth rate of Rhizobium meliloti [69]. And, 
the  5,7-dihydroxyl  substitution  of  flavonoid  compounds 
was reported to be primarily responsible for inducing the 
observed growth effect on rhizobium populations [69].

Recent developments in root hair transformation tech-
niques allowed researchers to knock down flavonoid bio-
synthetic genes using RNAi to investigate the differential 
roles of flavonoids in root nodule formation. By silencing 
the CHS in Medicago, it was demonstrated that flavones 
are major inducers of nod genes in Sinorhizobium meliloti 
[70]. In addition, in vivo evidence further proved that fla-
vones  are  essential  for  nodulation  in  Medicago—in  this 
case—based on FNS knockout mutants [71]. In line with 
this, it was also shown that soybean IFS silenced mutants 
also  proved  the  importance  of  isoflavones  as  inducers 
of  nod  gene  expression  in  B.  japonicum  [70].  Additional 
analysis  of  root  exudates  from  faba  bean  (Vicia  faba) 
detected a total of six types of flavonoid compounds [72]. 
Within  these,  genistein  (a  isoflavone),  hesperetin  (a  fla-
vanone), and naringenin had significant correlations with 
nodule number and nodule dry weight [72]. All of these 
data suggest that flavonoids play a role in host specificity 
and selection of rhizobia strains for nodulation. Besides, 
auxin  accumulation  in  cortical  cells  was  also  shown  to

be  essential  for  nodule  initiation,  while  flavonoids  have 
a  role  in  polar  auxin  transportation  inhibition  [73,  74]. 
Last,  flavonoid  accumulation  during  this  process  was 
demonstrated  to  be  regulated  by  the  CRE1-dependent 
cytokinin signaling [75].
from 

interaction, 
actinorhizal  plants  are  known  to  form  symbioses  with 
nitrogen-fixing  Actinobacteria  taxa  (also  known  as 
“actinomycetes”),  in  particular,  those  belonging  to  the 
genus  Frankia.  Despite  the  mechanisms  underpinning 
these associations are yet not fully elucidated, one study 
has shown that flavonoids tend to accumulate inside the 
root  nodules  of  Casuarina  glauca  [76].  Most  interest-
ingly, flavonoid-like compounds extracted from seeds of 
Alnus  rubra  were  demonstrated  to  display  both,  nodu-
lation  induction  and  inhibition  activities  [77].  Also,  two 
dihydrochalcone  compounds  extracted  from  the  fruit  of 
Myrica gale were shown to enhance growth and nitrogen 
fixation  in  the  compatible  Frankia  strains  [78].  In  addi-
tion,  flavonoid  biosynthetic  genes  were  activated  in  the 
root of the actinorhizal tropical tree Alnus glutinosa and 
C. glauca after inoculation with a Frankia bacterial strain 
[79].  Last,  one  study  showed  a  reduction  in  nodule  for-
mation in flavonoid-deficient C. glauca root hairs and the 
rescue of nodule formation by the exogenous addition of 
naringenin [80].

The role of flavonoids in plant‑AMF interaction

Approximately  80%  of  land  plants  are  able  to  establish 
symbiosis  with  arbuscular  mycorrhizal  fungi  (AMF) 
(Fig.  2A)  [81].  This  symbiosis  is  one  of  the  major  inter-
actions impacting plant fitness, particularly under phos-
phorus-limiting  conditions  [82].  Specific  molecules  in 
root  exudates  (in  this  case,  those  belonging  to  a  class 
of  plant  hormones  called  “strigolactones”)  are  able  to 
stimulate  both  AMF  spore  germination  and  germ  tube 
branching  [83].  In  addition,  secondary  metabolites  like 
flavonoids in root exudates are also dynamically involved 
in this process. For example, quercetin (a flavonol) in car-
rot  (Daucus  carota)  root  exudates  was  demonstrated  to 
promote the hyphal growth of Gigaspora margarita [84]. 
This  result  corroborates  with  an  in  vitro  assay  show-
ing  that  the  exogenous  amendment  quercetin  induces 
hyphal  growth  and  hyphal  branching  of  Glomus  etuni-
catum  [85].  Also,  alfalfa  seeds  were  shown  to  naturally 
secrete  quercetin-3-O-galactoside,  which  stimulates  the 
spore  germination  of  G.  etunicatum  and  Glomus  mac-
rocarpum  [85].  Besides,  quercetin  secreted  by  the  roots 
of  the  Chinese  tallow  tree  (Triadica  sebifera)  was  found 
to promote the colonization of roots by AMF [86]. Based 
on  these  collective  findings,  further  studies  should  con-
sider  exploring  the  role  of  quercetin  as  a  direct  regula-
tor  of  AMF  establishment.  For  instance,  the  potential 

Wang et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:233

overexpression  of  quercetin  in  transgenic  plants  or 
the  exogenous  amendment  of  quercetin  in  prospective 
experimental systems can be used to potentially elucidate 
the  mechanisms  by  which  this  flavonoid  mediates  AMF 
colonization.

On  the  other  hand,  the  colonization  of  plant  roots  by 
AMF  promotes  plant  growth  and  can  significantly  alter 
the production of plant secondary metabolites, including 
flavonoids.  A  study  on  olive  (Olea  europaea)  tree  roots 
demonstrated that AMF colonization increased the plant 
production of flavonoids and total phenols [87]. Likewise, 
heartsease  (Viola  tricolor)  inoculated  with  Rhizophagus 
irregularis  BEG144  was  shown  to  produce  higher  levels 
of  rutin  (a  flavonol)  [88].  And,  upon  inoculation  with 
the  AMF  strain  Glomus  mosseae,  the  pruning  wastes  of 
grapevine  (Vitis  vinifera)  were  found  to  produce  larger 
amounts  of  quercetin  [89].  This  also  aligns  with  a  study 
showing  the  co-inoculation  of  G.  mosseae  and  the  bio-
fertilizer  Nitroxin  in  sorghum  to  significantly  increase 
grain and protein yield, as well as total flavonoid content 
under severe drought stress [90].

The role of flavonoids in plant‑PGPR interaction

Plant  growth-promoting  rhizobacteria 
(PGPR)  are 
microbes  able  to  promote  plant  growth  via  direct  or 
indirect mechanisms (Fig. 2A) [91]. Several studies have 
shown that flavonoids are active molecules mediating the 
communication  between  PGPRs  and  plants  suggested 
that flavonoids might be playing a key role in these inter-
actions. In addition, some studies have also reported the 
potential of specific microbial taxa to induce the expres-
sion  and/or  accumulation  of  flavonoids  in  plant  tissues. 
For  example,  one  study  reported  that  the  well-studied 
biocontrol PGPR Bacillus subtilis triggers flavonoid accu-
mulation in tobacco and contribute to the suppression of 
the  pathogen  Agrobacterium  tumefaciens  [92].  Further-
more, flavonoids, like  apigenin (a flavone) and  phloretin 
(a  chalcone),  were  shown  to  be  sensed  by  Pseudomonas 
fluorescens 2P24 via the TetR regulator PhlH. These flavo-
noids play an important role in enhancing the swarming 
motility  and  the  production  of  cellulose  and  curli  fibers 
in this non-symbiotic beneficial rhizobacterium. In addi-
tion,  this  mechanism  of  flavonoid  sensing  significantly 
contributes  to  the  ability  of  this  PGPR  to  move  in  the 
soil/root interface, thus favoring the successful coloniza-
tion of the plant root surface [93].

Flavonoids  are  also  involved  in  PGPR-mediated  plant 
tolerance  to  abiotic  stresses,  especially  salinity  stress. 
For example, wheat (Triticum aestivum) inoculated with 
Bacillus  pumilus,  Pseudomonas  mendocina,  Arthobacter 
sp., Halomonas sp., and Nitrinicola lacisaponensis exhib-
ited enhanced tolerance to salinity, in this case, an effect 
attributed  to  the  accumulation  of  quercetin  in  response 

to the inoculation [94]. Also, the symbiotic plant growth-
promoting  actinobacterium  Glutamicibacter  halophyto-
cola strain KLBMP5180 isolated from root tissues of the 
coastal  halophyte  Limonium  sinense  was  shown  to  exert 
plant growth-promoting effects under salinity stress [95]. 
A study that integrated metabolomics and transcriptom-
ics analyses demonstrated that flavonoids induced by the 
inoculation  of  KLBMP5180  are  important  in  host  salt 
stress  tolerance  [95].  It  was  also  reported  that  root  exu-
dates  of  L.  sinense  attract  PGPR  taxa,  such  as  Bacillus 
flexus KLBMP4941 under salt stress, which is associated 
with  flavonoid  accumulation  and  enhancement  of  plant 
growth  [96].  Moreover,  the  inoculation  of  Azospirillum 
lipoferum  FK1  in  salt-treated  chickpea  (Cicer  arietinum 
L.)  was  demonstrated  to  significantly  promote  plant 
growth  via  increased  flavonoid  production  [97].  Worth 
mentioning,  similar  results  were  also  reported  in  NaCl-
treated  soybean  inoculated  with  Bacillus  firmus  SW5 
[98].

Flavonoids have also been shown to contribute to plant 
tolerance  to  water  and  nutrient  deficiencies  via  PGPR 
recruitment  and  microbial  activities.  For  example,  the 
inoculation of drought-treated pennyroyal (Mentha pule-
gium  L.)  with  Azotobacter  chroococcum  and  Azosporol-
lum brasilense enhanced the total flavonoid accumulation 
and improved plant growth [99]. Recently, the bacterium 
Aeromonas sp. H1 was reported to enhance the dehydra-
tion resistance of Arabidopsis via specific flavonoid accu-
mulation  [100].  Also,  the  presence  of  Steotrophomonas 
maltophilia enhanced the total flavonoid content in pea-
nut  (Arachis  hypogea),  in  this  case,  under  nitrogen-lim-
iting  conditions  [101].  And,  root-derived  flavones,  such 
as apigenin and luteolin, were demonstrated to promote 
the  enrichment  of  Oxalobacteraceae  taxa  associated 
with  maize  growth  under  nitrogen-limiting  conditions 
[102].  Moreover,  apigenin  and  luteolin  in  the  exudates 
of rice plants were shown to trigger biofilm formation of 
Gluconacetobacter  diazotrophicus,  thus  enhancing  the 
potential of root surface colonization and improving bio-
logical nitrogen fixation under nutrient-limiting soil con-
ditions [103].

Despite that we still lack a full appreciation of the spec-
ificity of diverse flavonoid molecules mediating the inter-
action  between  plants  and  PGPRs,  some  studies  have 
shown  that  the  inoculation  with  a  single  PGPR  strain 
is  able  to  induce  flavonoid  accumulation  in  plants.  For 
example,  after  the  inoculation  with  Paenibacillus  pabuli 
strain  P7S,  the  biomass  and  anthocyanin  production  in 
Arabidopsis were found to increase [104]. Also, Eucalyp-
tus  grandis  “treated”  with  Streptomyces  PM9  displayed 
higher  levels  of  flavonoids  in  shoots,  albeit  similar  val-
ues were reported in root tissues [105]. Last, an elevated 
flavonoid  accumulation  was  also  detected  in  grapevine

leaves and roots inoculated with Paraburkholderia phyto-
firmans  PsJN  [106].  Thus,  taken  together,  these  results 
illustrate  that  PGPR  inoculation  may  improve  host 
plant  performance—to  some  extent—by  mediating  the 
dynamic  flavonoid  accumulation  that  varies  across  dis-
tinct contexts and environmental conditions.

elastase)  [114,  115].  Last,  similar  results  have  also  been 
reported  in  other  pathogens,  such  as  Staphylococcus 
epidermidis  [116].  Thus,  it  is  possible  to  speculate  that 
flavonoids  might  likely  be  a  yet-underexplored  class  of 
molecules  potentially  associated  with  pathogen  control, 
for instance, via quorum-sensing suppression.

The role of flavonoids in bacterial quorum sensing

Quorum  sensing  is  a  bacterial  cell-to-cell  communica-
tion  process  triggered  by  auto-inducers  (AIs)  signaling 
molecules  once  cell  density  reaches  a  certain  threshold. 
Quorum  sensing  mediates  a  series  of  bacterial  genes 
expression  associated  with  important  functions,  such  as 
the  production  of  enzymes,  secretion  of  exopolysaccha-
rides and toxins, the establishment of biofilm, swarming 
motility, and horizontal gene transfer [107]. The class of 
molecules  of  N-acyl  homoserine  lactones  (AHLs)  is  the 
most  studied  AIs  present  in  Gram-negative  bacteria. 
Most  interestingly,  some  specific  flavonoid  molecules 
can be further transformed into AHL types. For example, 
naringenin  (a  flavanone),  daidzein  and  genistein  (isofla-
vones) in the rhizosphere were shown to be broken down 
by  Rhizobium  species  to  form  p-coumaric  acid  [108]. 
And,  in  a  follow-up  step,  p-coumaric  acid  can  be  trans-
formed  into  p-coumaroyl-homoserine  lactone  (a  type 
of  AHL)  by  the  photosynthetic  bacterium  Rhodopseu-
domonas  palustris  [109].  In  addition,  the  production  of 
AHL molecules in three rhizobia species (Sinorhizobium 
fredii SMH12, Rhizobium etli ISP42, and Rhizobium sul-
lae IS123) was shown to be enhanced when these strains 
were cultured in the presence of specific flavonoids (nod 
gene inducer) [110]. On the other hand, Medicago plants 
inoculated  with  rhizobia-producing  AHLs  were  also 
shown  to  enhance  the  expression  of  genes  associated 
with flavonoid biosynthesis [111]. Albeit the significance 
of this study, the opposite effect has also been reported. 
For  example,  it  was  shown  that  barley  plants  produced 
a  lower  amount  of  flavonoids  when  inoculated  with  the 
AHL-deficient  mutant  of  Acidovorax  radices  N35  com-
pared with wild-type A. radices N35 [112].

Flavonoids  can  also  have  a  direct  effect  on  strain-spe-
cific  bacterial  quorum  sensing.  For  example,  one  study 
showed  that  flavonoid  compounds  can  inhibit  biofilm 
formation  in  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  via  effects  in  the 
AI-binding receptors, namely LasR and RhlR [113]. Fur-
ther, two hydroxyl moieties in the A-ring backbone were 
shown  to  be  essential  for  this  inhibition  activity  [113]. 
Also,  naringenin  was  found  to  be  effective  in  inhibit-
ing  quorum-sensing  response  in  P.  aeruginosa  via  bind-
ing  directly  to  the  LasR  only  at  low  concentrations  of 
AIs  [114].  This  effect  of  quorum-sensing  suppression 
in  P.  aeruginosa  was  also  shown  to  result  in  reduced 
production  of  virulence  factors  (i.e.,  pyocyanin  and 

Multifaceted roles of flavonoids mediating the assembly 
and functioning of root microbiomes

Several  products  of  PSM  in  root  exudates—includ-
ing  phytohormones  and  diverse  flavonoid  molecules—
dynamically  regulate  the  recruitment  and  functioning 
of  microbial  taxa  in  the  rhizosphere  [49,  117,  118].  For 
example,  a  study  showed  the  importance  of  triterpenes 
(another  class  of  PSM  found  in  Arabidopsis  root  exu-
dates)  in  structuring  the  plant  root  microbiome  [12].  In 
fact, most flavonoid molecules can act as signals for the 
recruitment of specific microbial taxa and/or act as sub-
strates  for  microbial  growth,  thus  linking  their  produc-
tion and consumption with the recruitment in the plant 
rhizosphere [100]. In addition, some flavonoids can also 
have  a  negative  effect  on  taxa  recruitment,  for  instance, 
via  anti-microbial  activities  [48,  117].  Although  some 
of  these  aspects  were  covered  in  the  previous  sections 
of  this  article,  herewith  we  provide  a  more  holistic  per-
spective  on  how  flavonoids  can  be  seen  as  underlying 
regulatory molecules in plant exudates that influence the 
overall root microbiome recruitment and functioning.

Flavonoids modulate dynamic changes in rhizosphere 
microbiomes

Due  to  the  importance  of  dietary  intake  of  flavonoids 
influencing  human  health,  interactions  between  flavo-
noids  and  microbiomes  are  particularly  well  described 
in the human and (model) animal gut systems. Similar to 
the plant rhizosphere, the animal gut also has a dynamic 
gradient  of  nutrients  that  provides  multiple  resources 
and  ecological  niches  for  microbial  colonization.  Albeit 
major differences exist between these two systems, con-
cepts derived from one system can easily be interpreted 
and  translated  into  the  other.  The  most  striking  differ-
ence  between  these  systems  relies  on  the  distinct  con-
centrations of oxygen in these habitats and how it affects 
microbial  taxa  recruitment  and  chemical  reactions  in 
the  system.  Some  microbes  in  the  human  gut  can  con-
sume,  modify,  or  degrade  flavonoids.  For  example,  a 
novel ene-reductase that initiates the degradation of fla-
vones and flavonols, namely flavone reductase (FLR), was 
discovered  in  the  gut  bacterium  Flavonifractor  plautii 
ATCC  49531  [119].  Besides,  it  was  shown  that  strains 
belonging to Lactococcus and Enterococcus isolated from 
human  fecal  samples  have  de-glycosylation  activities  for 
specific  C-  and  O-glycosides  of  flavonoids  [120,  121]. 

Wang et al. Microbiome          (2022) 10:233

These  authors  also  reported  that  the  bacterium  Blautia 
sp.  MRG-PMF1  is  able  to  demethylate  multiple  polym-
ethoxyflavones  [122].  In  addition,  flavonoids  ingested  in 
the  diet  can  affect  patterns  of  gastrointestinal  microbial 
community  assembly  [123,  124].  For  example,  as  one  of 
the primary components in multiple plant extracts (e.g., 
cucumber,  carrot,  and  broccoli  seed  flours),  kaemp-
ferol-3-O-rutinoside  (a  flavonol)  was  reported  to  pro-
mote  an  increase  in  the  diversity  of  the  gut  microbial 
community,  possibly  through  their  scavenging  capacity 
of  reactive  oxygen  species  [125].  Also,  as  an  important 
active  flavonoid  derivative,  quercetin-3-O-glucuronide 
(a  flavonol)  was  found  to  partially  restore  the  dysbiosis 
of  the  gut  microbiome  (i.e.,  affecting  the  Bacteroidetes 
and  Firmicute  balance).  In  addition,  the  administration 
of  quercetin  was  reported  to  improve  the  gut  microbial 
diversity  in  mice  that  were  previously  treated  with  anti-
biotics  [126].  Also,  another  study  highlights  the  link 
between  the  anti-inflammatory  property  of  quercetin 
and  the  gut  microbiome  in  mice  models  used  to  study 
inflammatory bowel disease. Specifically, the abundances 
of  Lactobacillus,  Bacteroidetes,  and  Bifidobacterium 
were  reported  to  increase,  whereas  the  abundances  of 
Fusobacterium  and  Enterococcus  decreased  by  querce-
tin  pre-administration  [127].  In  an  example  based  on  a 
non-model mammal system, a total of 97 flavonoids were 
identified in bamboo, of which more than 70% were able 
to  be  metabolized  by  the  panda  gut  microbiome.  These 
were further demonstrated to negatively affect microbial 
diversity by enriching the abundance of cellulose-degrad-
ing microbes [128].

Particularly  in  the  soil  and  plant  rhizosphere,  it  was 
shown  that  soils  treated  with  daidzein—an  important 
flavonoid  found  in  Medicago  root  exudates—had  a  sig-
nificant  negative  effect  on  α-diversity  (i.e.,  for  bacterial 
community),  suggesting  a  potential  impact  on  specific 
soil microbial populations [48]. Similarly, the α-diversity 
of  a  soil  microbiome  treated  with  quercetin  was  also 
reduced,  albeit  this  treatment  resulted  in  the  positive 
growth of specific (and potentially beneficial) taxa [117]. 
In detail, the soil treated with daidzein led to an increase 
in  the  relative  abundance  of  Comamonadaceae  [48], 
while the soil treated with quercetin resulted in a relative 
enrichment of Pseudarthrobacter, in addition to a higher 
overall relative abundance of Proteobacteria [117]. Also, 
a  study  on  maize  root  exudates  showed  flavone  com-
pounds,  such  as  apigenin  and  luteolin,  to  enhance  the 
abundance of Oxalobacteraceae in the plant rhizosphere. 
In  line  with  that,  microbial  isolates  within  the  Massilia 
genus (also Oxalobacteraceae) are known to improve host 
performance  under  nutrient-limiting  conditions  [102]. 
Last,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  properly  studying 
flavonoids  in  soil  systems  is  often  challenging,  mostly 

due to the chemical interactions of these molecules with 
other  soil  particles.  For  example,  it  was  shown  that  dis-
solved organic carbon in soil can significantly reduce the 
lifetime of flavonoids, which, in turn, directly affects the 
signaling communication mediated by these molecules in 
the system [47].

Differential responses of microbial taxa to plant‑derived 
flavonoids

Flavonoids  as  complex  signaling  molecules  can  be  per-
ceived,  consumed,  and  modified  by  different  microbial 
taxa. Also, the specificity of these molecules and chemi-
cal dynamics can differentially influence taxa abundances 
and the overall microbiome composition [102]. As men-
tioned above, the de-glycosylation of O- and C-glycosides 
of  flavonoids  performed  by  gut  microbes  is  an  example 
of  gut-specialized  taxa  capable  of  hydrolyzing  flavonoid 
glycosides.  Also,  flavonoid  aglycones  released  in  the  gut 
were shown to be degraded into small molecules by spe-
cialized microbial enzymes [119–121]. Conversely, simi-
lar enzymatic processing of flavonoids has been reported 
in  the  rhizosphere  [117].  Mounting  evidence  has  been 
suggesting  specific  microbial  taxa,  such  as  Rhizobia  and 
Pseudomonas,  to  actively  degrade  flavonoid  molecules 
[46, 108]. These molecules are used as energy sources by 
specialized  microbes  directly  via  the  degradation  of  the 
carbon  skeleton  of  flavonoids  and  further  channeling  of 
by-product  degradation  into  the  tricarboxylic  acid  cycle 
[46].

As  an  additional  mechanism  of  microbiome  modula-
tion, molecules derived from the degradation of flavonoid 
compounds  (e.g.,  phenolic  acids)  present  in  root  exu-
dates  can  also  affect  the  rhizosphere  microbiome  [129]. 
In addition, these derived molecules often exhibit higher 
antioxidant activities than the precursor molecules [130], 
which  may  not  only  affect  the  specialized  taxa  but  the 
overall micro-scale environment in the plant rhizosphere. 
Last, it is tempting to speculate that since a similar mole-
cule can often have opposite effects (positive or negative) 
on  distinct  microbial  taxa,  the  production,  perception, 
and  utilization  of  different  flavonoids  might  likely  be 
associated  with  eco-evolutionary  dynamics  of  the  host 
with distinct microbial taxa in the system, thus serving as 
a resource that triggers species interactions. In this sense, 
microbes may likely compete with each other in a direct 
or  indirect  manner  [131],  which  may  contribute  to  the 
dynamic structure and functioning of microbiomes.

Conclusions and future perspectives
Flavonoids  are  plant  metabolites  with  a  variety  of  func-
tions  in  both  eukaryotic  and  prokaryotic  organisms. 
Although the biosynthesis and metabolisms of flavonoids 
in  plants  have  been  broadly  studied,  the  multifaceted

roles of these compounds mediating host-microbe inter-
actions  remain  largely  unexplored.  This  includes  their 
dynamic overall effects on community assembly and the 
molecular  mechanisms  by  which  these  molecules  act  as 
chemical signals in the plant rhizosphere. Given the cur-
rent need to harness specific microbial taxa and functions 
toward the development of sustainable practices in agro-
ecosystems [132], better understanding the influences of 
flavonoids and their derivatives on plant commensal taxa 
has fundamental implications. In this sense, different and 
complementary focuses are emerging in this field, includ-
ing  the  sensing  mechanisms  of  flavonoids  by  microbes 
and their signal transduction in the cells [133], as well as 
the ecological implications of flavonoids as mediators of 
host-microbe interactions [102]. Of key importance, sev-
eral plant mutant lines are currently available to investi-
gate the potential roles of specific flavonoid molecules in 
rhizosphere  biology  [134].  These  plant  mutant  libraries 
can  be  used  to  explore  how  distinct  root  exudates  con-
taining  distinct  flavonoid  compositions  and  concentra-
tions dynamically affect the recruitment and functioning 
of microbial taxa in the rhizosphere. As a follow-up, the 
modulation  of  specific  microbial  populations  via  flavo-
noid metabolism to either include the loss-of-function or 
gain-of-function in the system might emerge as a prom-
ising  approach  to  effectively  engineer  plant-beneficial 
microbiomes.
