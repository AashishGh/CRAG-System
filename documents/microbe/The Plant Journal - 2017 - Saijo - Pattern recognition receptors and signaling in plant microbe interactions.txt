SUMMARY

Plants solely rely on innate immunity of each individual cell to deal with a diversity of microbes in the envi-
ronment. Extracellular recognition of microbe- and host damage-associated molecular patterns leads to the
ﬁrst layer of inducible defenses, termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). In plants, pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) described to date are all membrane-associated receptor-like kinases or receptor-like pro-
teins, reﬂecting the prevalence of apoplastic colonization of plant-infecting microbes. An increasing inven-
tory of elicitor-active patterns and PRRs indicates that a large number of them are limited to a certain range
of plant groups/species, pointing to dynamic and convergent evolution of pattern recognition speciﬁcities.
In addition to common molecular principles of PRR signaling, recent studies have revealed substantial diver-
siﬁcation between PRRs in their functions and regulatory mechanisms. This serves to confer robustness and
plasticity to the whole PTI system in natural infections, wherein different PRRs are simultaneously engaged
and faced with microbial assaults. We review the functional signiﬁcance and molecular basis of PRR-
mediated pathogen recognition and disease resistance, and also an emerging role for PRRs in homeostatic
association with beneﬁcial or commensal microbes.

Keywords: pattern recognition receptors, microbe-associated molecular patterns, damage-associated
molecular patterns, plant immunity, plant–microbe interactions, signaling, receptor-like protein, receptor-
like kinase.

INTRODUCTION TO PLANT IMMUNITY

In plants, each individual cell expresses a repertoire of
innate immune receptors that recognize invasion signals
(Jones and Dangl, 2006). At
the cell surfaces, pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) detect molecular structures
typical of microbes, termed microbe-associated molecular
patterns (MAMPs), or endogenous signals generated upon
cellular disintegration, termed damage-associated molecu-
lar patterns (DAMPs), and thereby mount pattern-triggered
immunity (PTI; Figure 1). PTI plays an important role in
preventing non-adapted microbes, whether pathogens or
not, from infecting the host, termed non-host resistance,
and also in restricting infection of adapted pathogens in
susceptible hosts, termed basal resistance (Couto and Zip-
fel, 2016; Tang et al., 2017). In turn, pathogens employ a
wide array of virulence effectors to overcome PTI and
establish successful
termed effector-triggered
susceptibility (ETS). However, host recognition of one or

termed effector-triggered immunity
(ETI). Compared with PTI, ETI displays an ampliﬁed and
robust form of defense programs, which is often accompa-
nied by localized cell death called the hypersensitive
response (Katagiri and Tsuda, 2010). Reiterating cycles of
PTI, ETS and ETI drive host–pathogen co-evolution that
has led to the diversiﬁcation of effector functions and NLR
recognition speciﬁcities, as illustrated in the zigzag model
(Jones and Dangl, 2006). Of note, indirect recognition of
pathogen effector actions is functionally analogous to PRR-
mediated recognition of DAMPs. This leads to a notion that
plant immunity serves as a surveillance system for danger
signals in both extracellular and intracellular milieus (Cook
et al., 2015; Gust et al., 2017). Here, we review PRR

Figure 1. An overview of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI).
Perception of microbe-/damage-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/DAMPs, respectively) by cognate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involves dynamic
association/dissociation with co-receptors and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), and transphosphorylation within the PRR complexes to initiate the
downstream signaling. PRR-derived signals are transmitted via further phosphorylation cascades including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and
calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) to the downstream targets such as the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, the plasma membrane (PM)-resident H+-ATPases
and transcriptional factors (TFs) during PTI.

functions and regulations that are central to the elaborate
immune system of plants.

KEY PRINCIPLES OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND
RECEPTOR-TRIGGERED SIGNALING

Plant PRRs include receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and recep-
tor-like proteins (RLPs; Couto and Zipfel, 2016; Boutrot and
Zipfel, 2017). RLKs are composed of an extracellular
domain,
transmembrane domain and an intracellular
kinase domain, whereas RLPs lack the intracellular kinase
domain. LRRs, lysin motifs (LysMs), lectin-like motifs and
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains are among
ligand-binding ectodomains described to date. Ectodomain
classes largely correspond to the nature of the ligands
recognized.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the LRR-RLK FLS2 recognizes an
N-terminal 22-amino-acid epitope (ﬂg22) of bacterial ﬂag-
ellin. ﬂg22 recognition speciﬁcities are widespread in
higher plants (Gomez-Gomez and Boller, 2000; Hann and
Rathjen, 2007; Robatzek et al., 2007; Takai et al., 2008; Bol-
ler and Felix, 2009; Trda et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017).
FLS2 is required for bacterial resistance in particular fol-
lowing leaf surface inoculation, providing evidence that
links PRR to pathogen resistance (Zipfel et al., 2004). The
LRR-RLK EFR recognizes an N-acetylated 18–26-amino-acid
epitope (elf18–elf26) of elongation factor (EF)-Tu, one of
the most abundant proteins of bacterial cells, during bacte-
rial resistance (Kunze et al., 2004; Zipfel et al., 2006). elf18
perception seems restricted to the Brassicaceae family

(Boller and Felix, 2009), but the introduction of EFR alone
is sufﬁcient to confer elf18 responsiveness and bacterial
resistance in other plant
families (Zipfel et al., 2006;
Lacombe et al., 2010). This suggests that PRRs function as
a replaceable module in PTI, and that pathogens are specif-
ically adapted to the existing PRR repertoire of the host.
The successful
interfamily transfer of EFR demonstrates
the effectiveness of increasing the existing PRR repertoire
in breeding disease resistance (Lacombe et al., 2010;
Schoonbeek et al., 2015; Schwessinger et al., 2015). FLS2
and EFR both belong to the LRR-RK class XII (Shiu et al.,
2004), and offer excellent PRR models.

Following ligand perception, FLS2 and EFR both involve
the LRR-RLK BAK1 (and related SERKs) in the receptor
complexes (Chinchilla et al., 2007; Heese et al., 2007; Roux
et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2016), as shown for the LRR-RLK
brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRI1 (Li et al., 2002; Nam
and Li, 2002; Santiago et al., 2013). Crystal structure of
ﬂg22-bound FLS2-BAK1 ectodomains indicates that BAK1
acts as a co-receptor (Sun et al., 2013). Structure has been
solved or simulated for ligand-bound ectodomains of dif-
ferent BAK1 (or SERK)-associated LRR-RLKs (Song et al.,
2017). Likewise, many LRR-RLPs constitutively associate
with the adapter LRR-RLK SOBIR1, and then involve BAK1
in response to ligands (Gust and Felix, 2014; Liebrand
et al., 2014; Yasuda et al., 2017). These heteromeric PRR
complexes

kinases (RLCKs) such as BIK1 in intercellular signaling

association leads to BAK1 activation and phosphorylation
of BIK1, and then BIK1 dissociation to mediate down-
stream signaling (Lu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Sch-
wessinger et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2014). As such, PRR
signaling occurs through dynamic association/dissociation
and trans-phosphorylation of signaling components within
and downstream of PRR kinase complexes.

Ligand-induced formation of heteromeric receptor com-
plexes is subject to multi-layered regulation.
In resting
cells, BAK1 is retained in different complexes involving the
LRR-RLK pseudokinase BIR2 or BIR3, thereby restricting
precocious PRR-BAK1 association (Halter et al., 2014;
Imkampe et al., 2017). In response to ﬂg22, a pool of BAK1
is dissociated from BIR2 or BIR3, and then allowed to form
an active FLS2-BAK1 complex. BIR3 also associates with
FLS2 and BRI1 to restrict PTI and BR signaling, respec-
tively. Likewise,
the LRR-RLK pseudokinase BIR1 also
sequesters BAK1 from BAK1-SOBIR1 association and PTI
signaling, until BAK1 is recruited to ligand-bound PRRs
(Gao et al., 2009; Li et al., 2016a).

Pattern recognition receptor abundance is also tightly
the U-box E3 ligases
controlled. Together with BAK1,
PUB12 and PUB13 are recruited to the FLS2 complex in
response to ﬂg22 (Lu et al., 2011). BAK1 phosphorylation
of PUB12/PUB13 leads to FLS2 ubiquitination by the E3
ligases for receptor degradation. Consistent with this, FLS2
signaling outputs and bacterial resistance are enhanced in
pub12 pub13 plants. Following ligand-induced association
with BAK1, FLS2 also undergoes endocytosis via clathrin
and subsequent degradation (Robatzek et al., 2006; Chin-
chilla et al., 2007; Mbengue et al., 2016). This leads to tran-
sient desensitization of FLS2 signaling, but is followed by
replenishment with de novo synthesized receptor (Smith
et al., 2014). This regulation also occurs on different BAK1-
associated PRRs (Mbengue et al., 2016; Ortiz-Morea et al.,
2016; Postma et al., 2016; Yamada et al., 2016c), and is clo-
sely associated with effective defense activation (Mbengue
et al., 2016), pointing to a positive role for speciﬁc turnover
ligand-bound receptor pools in PTI signaling. Their
of
replenishment may occur through the exocyst Exo70B2
complex, a process suppressed by the E3 ligases PUB22/
PUB23/PUB24 (Trujillo et al., 2008; Stegmann et al., 2012).
Along with such cellular dynamics of PRRs, pattern-
induced re-distribution between different membrane frac-
tions was described for PTI signaling components (Keinath
et al., 2010). Advanced live-imaging with variable-angle
epiﬂuorescence microscopy and single-particle tracking
revealed ligand-induced relocalization of FLS2 and BRI1 to
deﬁned microdomains (Bucherl et al., 2017). This indicates
that ligand-induced receptor compartmentalization within
membrane microdomains enables spatiotemporal separa-
tion and speciﬁc control of receptor signaling.

The phosphorylation states of key protein kinases and
their substrates involved in PRR signaling are also subject

Ser/Thr phos-
phatases type 2A (PP2A) negatively regulate phosphoryla-
tion levels of BAK1 and thus EFR-mediated defenses
(Segonzac et al., 2014). PP2Cs also negatively regulate EFR
and Xa21, a receptor mediating resistance to Xanthomonas
oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) in rice (Park et al., 2008; Holton
et al., 2015). Moreover, phosphorylation of EFR Tyr836,
conserved within related LRR-RLK PRRs, is crucial for PTI
signaling and is targeted for dephosphorylation by the
Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) virulence effector
HopAO1 (Macho et al., 2014). In resting complexes with
EFR/FLS2, BIK1 is also kept inactive by PP2C38 (Couto
et al., 2016).

RECOGNITION OF BACTERIAL MAMPS

An inventory of elicitor-active patterns and PRRs has been
extended in plants (Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017; Table 1). Flag-
ellin has different elicitor-active epitopes than ﬂg22 (Tagu-
chi et al., 2003; Takeuchi et al., 2003; Katsuragi et al.,
2015). One such epitope undergoing strong selection
against elicitor activity, termed ﬂgII-28, was revealed by
population genomics study on ﬁeld Pst isolates in tomato
(Cai et al., 2011).
Importantly, allelic variations of plant-
infecting bacteria in both ﬂg22 and ﬂgII-28 epitopes signiﬁ-
cantly affect the strength of plant immune responses (Felix
et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2006; Clarke et al., 2013), without
discernible effects on bacterial motility (Clarke et al., 2013).
Structural differences of ﬂagellin also inﬂuence bacterial
virulence in rice (Che et al., 2000). Loss of ﬂagellin from
non-adapted bacteria allows their proliferation in non-host
plants (Li et al., 2005). These ﬁndings suggest that ﬂagellin
recognition deﬁnes a critical determinant of plant–bac-
terium interactions, and that MAMP diversiﬁcation facili-
tates PTI evasion. Indeed, similar to ﬂagellin, substantial
polymorphisms exist in elicitor-active regions of otherwise
highly conserved pathogen proteins (Vinatzer et al., 2014).
A search for such signatures in orthologous genes of six
bacterial pathogens (but not in seven non-pathogens) iden-
tiﬁed novel MAMPs that are recognized in A. thaliana
(McCann et al., 2012). A middle region of EF-Tu, in addition
to elf18, also undergoes positive selection. This region
overlaps with an elicitor-active fragment of EF-Tu puriﬁed
from the bacterium Acidovorax avenae extracts, which is
predominantly recognized in rice (Furukawa et al., 2014).

Microbe-associated molecular pattern recognition speci-
ﬁcities often display plant lineage-speciﬁc or intra-species
variations, possibly reﬂecting plant adaptation to MAMP
diversiﬁcation in microbial populations. In tomato, natural
variation studies revealed the class XII LRR-RLK FLS3 as
the ﬂgII-28 receptor, demonstrating that plants employ dif-
ferent PRRs to recognize separate patterns from the same
microbial protein (Hind et al., 2016). Interestingly, ﬂgII-28
alleles inﬂuence bacterial virulence in A. thaliana in a man-
ner dependent on FLS2 (Clarke et al., 2013). Given their

lack of direct binding to FLS2, it is interesting to determine
how ﬂgII-28 alterations inﬂuence ﬂg22 recognition and/or
FLS2-triggered immunity.

Peptidoglycans (PGNs) constitute cell walls of most bac-
teria, and their fragments, muropeptides, are released as a
consequence of cell wall
remodeling during bacterial
growth. PGNs thus serve as signals, indicative of bacterial
growth state, within bacterial populations and for eukary-
otic hosts (Dworkin, 2014), and their perception induces
immune responses in plants, insects and mammals (Felix
and Boller, 2003; Guan and Mariuzza, 2007; Gust et al.,
2007). N-deacetylation of PGNs dampens
immune
response and helps Listeria evade from host immunity,
possibly through reduced receptor binding (Boneca et al.,
2007). It is possible that the host discriminates structurally
distinct PGN fragments from growing and resting bacteria.
PGN perception occurs through LysM domain-containing
proteins, which are widespread in almost all kingdoms of
life (Zhang et al., 2009).
In A. thaliana, the LysM-RLPs
AtLYM1 and AtLYM3 recognize PGNs, and presumably act
in a complex with the LysM-RLK CERK1 during bacterial
resistance (Willmann et al., 2011). Notably, LYM1/LYM3
can bind both complex and soluble PGNs from Gram-
negative or Gram-positive bacteria, while CERK1 does not.
By contrast, CERK1, but not LYM1/LYM3, binds chitin, a
cell wall component of fungi (Iizasa et al., 2010; Petutsch-
nig et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012b), implying that CERK1 is
co-opted as an adapter for LYM1/LYM3 receptors. In rice,
the LysM-RLPs OsLYP4 (orthologous to LYM3) and OsLYP6
directly bind PGNs as well as chitin, thereby mediating
both bacterial and fungal resistance (Liu et al., 2012a). It is
interesting to determine the molecular basis for the ligand
promiscuity of these receptors. OsLYP4/OsLYP6 associates
with and requires OsCERK1 in PGN and chitin signaling,
although OsCERK1 fails to bind these ligands (Liu et al.,
2012a; Kouzai et al., 2014).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) consists of three moieties, lipid
A, a core oligosaccharide and a variable O-polysaccharide
region. As the major outer-membrane component of
Gram-negative bacteria, LPS provides a shield for bacteria
but also MAMPs for their mammal and plant hosts (Ranf,
2016; Kagan, 2017). However, the use of LPS preparations
from bacterial cultures in tracing plant immune responses
raises concerns about possible contaminations of different
MAMPs (Leulier et al., 2003). Convincing evidence for plant
LPS perception was obtained with the discovery of the A.
thaliana lectin S-domain RLK LORE (previously known as
SD1-29) speciﬁcally required for LPS recognition from
Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas species (Ranf et al.,
2015). LORE-mediated LPS recognition is restricted to the
Brassicaceae family, but LORE introduction is sufﬁcient to
transfer LPS recognition speciﬁcity to Nicotiana benthami-
ana (Solanaceae). This points to a critical role for LORE in
LPS perception, although direct LPS–LORE binding

remains to be shown. Remarkably, LORE is not required
for LPS recognition from Escherichia coli
(Ranf et al.,
2015), suggesting the existence of different LPS receptors
in plants, as shown in mammals.

A genome-sequence-based screen on P. syringae iso-
lates for bacterial conserved proteins carrying a region

under strong positive selection revealed six new MAMPs,
including xanthine/uracil permease (xup25 epitope). The
class XII LRR-RLK XPS1 directly recognizes xup25, thereby
conferring bacterial resistance (Mott et al., 2016). Compara-
tive genomics approaches will be useful in further discov-
eries of MAMP–PRR pairs.

2016a). CORE is conserved in the Solanaceae family, but
its introduction confers full csp22 sensitivity and, notably,
enhanced Pst resistance in A. thaliana. Given the inherent
adaptation of Pst to tomato PTI
involving CORE, CORE
may differentially mediate bacterial resistance in the two
host plants.

RECOGNITION OF FUNGAL MAMPS

Chitin, a linear polymer (degree of polymerization ≥ 6) of b-
(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and its deacety-
lated derivative chitosan are major components of fungal
cell wall,and recognized as MAMPs in a wide range of
plants (Boller and Felix, 2009). Chitin recognition requires
the LysM-RLK CERK1 (Shinya et al., 2015). In rice, OsCERK1
does not directly bind chitin, but functions with the chitin-
binding LysM-RLP OsCEBiP in a receptor complex (Kaku
et al., 2006; Shimizu et al., 2010; Hayafune et al., 2014). In
addition, the chitin-binding LysM-RLPs OsLYP4 and OsLYP6
also seem to function with OsCERK1 (Liu et al., 2012a;
Kouzai et al., 2014). In A. thaliana, CERK1 directly binds
chitin, thereby mediating chitin-triggered immunity (Miya
et al., 2007; Wan et al., 2008; Iizasa et al., 2010; Petutschnig
et al., 2010). In accordance with this, all three CEBiP homo-
logs, LYM1, LYM2 and LYM3, are dispensable for CERK1-
dependent chitin recognition (Wang et al., 2012; Faulkner
together with
et al., 2013), although LYM1 and LYM3,
CERK1, are required for PGN recognition (Willmann et al.,
2011). LYM2 is, however,
required for chitin-induced
closure of plasmodesmata and fungal resistance that are
independent of CERK1 (Faulkner et al., 2013; Narusaka
et al., 2013). Consistent with this, of the three LYMs, LYM2
can speciﬁcally bind chitin (Shinya et al., 2012). Recent
studies revealed that the chitin-binding LysM-RLK pseudok-
inase LYK5 physically associates with CERK1 to mediate
CERK1 homodimerization and phosphorylation in response
to chitin (Cao et al., 2014). Loss of LYK5 together with clo-
sely related LYK4, as well as that of CERK1, renders plants
insensitive to chitin. Two separate perception systems,
involving LYK5/LYK4-CERK1 or LYM2, are employed for
different chitin responses in A. thaliana.

Ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX) is recognized in tomato
via the LRR-RLPs Eix2 and Eix1 (Ron and Avni, 2004). In
response to EIX, Eix2 induces defense responses including
upregulation of Eix1, whose EIX binding in turn attenuates
Eix2 signaling by functioning with BAK1 (Bar et al., 2010).
Fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs) hydrolyze polygalac-
turonic acid, the main component of plant cell wall pectin,
and also display elicitor activity that is independent of
enzymatic activity (Poinssot et al., 2003). Natural variation

Pattern recognition receptors in plants 597

studies revealed the A. thaliana LRR-RLP42 (RBGP1), which
recognizes several PGs from Botrytis cinerea and mediates
PG-induced resistance to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis
(Hpa) in a manner dependent on SOBIR1 (Zhang et al.,
2014).

RECOGNITION OF OOMYCETE MAMPS

Despite intensive studies on devastating oomycete patho-
gens such as the potato late blight pathogen Phytoph-
limited for oomycete
thora infestans, knowledge is still
MAMP receptors in plants (Raaymakers and Van den Ack-
erveken, 2016). Oomycete MAMPs include cell wall com-
ponents, b-1,3- and b-1,6-glucans, glucan-chitosaccharides
lectin (CBEL; Fliegmann
and cellulose-binding elicitor
et al., 2004; Khatib et al., 2004; Nars et al., 2013). Natural
variations and BAK1 requirement were described for
CBEL responsiveness in A.
thaliana (Larroque et al.,
2013). The transglutaminase GP42 (Nurnberger et al.,
1994, 1995; Hahlbrock et al., 1995) and eicosapolyenoic
acids from Phytophthora mycelia also provide MAMPs
(Bostock et al., 1981). The Phytophthora xyloglucan-speci-
ﬁc endoglucanase XEG1 provides a virulence factor that
degrades b-glucan and xyloglucan, but also a MAMP that
is recognized by BAK1-dependent mechanisms (Ma et al.,
2015). For these MAMPs, cognate PRRs have yet to be
identiﬁed.

Necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (Nep1)-like
proteins (NLPs) are widespread from oomycetes to fungi
and bacteria. While most NLPs act as toxins inducing
necrosis and ethylene production in dicot plants, non-cyto-
toxic NLPs of Hpa helped identify 20–24 amino acid elici-
tor-active epitopes (nlp20/nlp24) conserved in NLPs across
microbial kingdoms (Bohm et al., 2014; Oome et al., 2014).
nlp20 induces defense activation without necrosis in Bras-
sicaceae species, but not in Solanaceous species (Bohm
et al., 2014). The A. thaliana LRR-RLP RLP23 identiﬁes an
nlp20 receptor, which acts together with SOBIR1 and BAK1
in bacterial and fungal resistance (Albert et al., 2015). The
interfamily transfer of RLP23 also confers P. infestans resis-
tance in potato.

Recognition of elicitins (~10 kDa), secreted proteins con-
served in oomycete pathogens,
induces necrosis and
pathogen resistance in tobacco (Ricci et al., 1989). The
LRR-RLP85 (ELR) from wild potato is required for recogni-
tion of a range of elicitins from different oomycete species,
including INF1 from P. infestans, although direct ELR-elici-
tin binding remains to be shown (Du et al., 2015). ELR
undergoes ligand-induced association with BAK1/SERK3.
ELR introduction is sufﬁcient to confer P. infestans resis-
tance in cultivated potato. In N. benthamiana, BAK1/SERK3
and SOBIR1 are both required for elicitin-triggered cell
death, implying the possible involvement of an ELR-BAK1-
SOBIR1 complex in elicitin perception and signaling (Peng
et al., 2015).

ORPHAN PRRS WITH THE COGNATE PATTERNS
UNIDENTIFIED

Natural variations of MAMP responsiveness have been
exploited to reveal MAMP recognition mechanisms, with-
out precise identiﬁcation of the MAMP itself. This approach
revealed the A. thaliana LRR-RLP ReMAX (RLP1) that medi-
ates immune responses to a protein fraction from X. axo-
nopodis pv citri (Xac) extracts, called eMAX (Jehle et al.,
together with SOBIR1 and
2013). The LRR-RLK RLP30,
BAK1, is required for recognition of the elicitor-active pro-
tein fraction from the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,
called SCFE1 (Zhang et al., 2013). In tomato, perception of
an as-yet-unidentiﬁed pattern from parasite plants, desig-
nated the Cuscuta factor, requires the LRR-RLP CuRe1,
which constitutively associates with SOBIR1 and mediates
Cuscuta reﬂexa resistance (Hegenauer et al., 2016).

PRRs

Perception mechanisms

are
employed in cell surface recognition of pathogen effectors
that act in the apoplasm. Recognition of such apoplastic
effectors from Cladosporium fulvum, Fusarium oxysporum
and Verticillium dahlia involves direct and indirect modes
of recognition (Table 1). In the latter cases, host cell pertur-
bations or changes associated with the effector actions are
recognized by these receptors, in a manner conceptually
analogous to DAMP recognition (see below).

RECOGNITION OF HOST CELL ALTERATIONS (DAMPS)

Because MAMPs are shared by pathogens and non-patho-
gens, simultaneous detection of DAMPs is considered to
represent signature of pathogenesis (Fontana and Vance,
2011; Blander and Sander, 2012). This hypothesis can now
be tested with a growing list of plant DAMPs (Gust et al.,
2017).

High-mobility group box protein (HMGB) is associated
with chromatin in the nucleus and also present in the cyto-
sol of non-stressed cells, but
is
immunogenic in both plants and mammals (Lotze and Tra-
cey, 2005; Choi and Klessig, 2016). In A. thaliana, HMGB3
is released upon tissue damage during B. cinerea infection,
thereby inducing PTI-like responses and fungal resistance
(Choi et al., 2016).

its extracellular pool

Extracellular ATP (eATP) triggers immune responses in
plants and humans (Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998; Tanaka
et al., 2014). In A. thaliana, the lectin-like RLK DORN1/LecRK-
I.9 recognizes eATP released in response to wounding, her-
bivory or pathogen attack to induce PTI-like defenses (Choi
et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016b). DORN1 is unrelated in structure
to the previously described nucleotide receptors in mam-
mals, again pointing to convergent evolution of eATP recog-
nition capacity. Whether ATP is actively exported as
described in humans remains to be determined in plants.

Oligogalacturonides (OGs), fragments of plant cell wall
pectin, are produced through hydrolysis by fungal or host

PGs during fungal infection or herbivory (Bergey et al., 1999;
De Lorenzo et al., 2001; Ferrari et al., 2013). OG recognition,
likely through the EGF-like RLK WAK1,
induces PTI-like
defenses (Denoux et al., 2008; Brutus et al., 2010). Cutin
monomers and cellulose-derived oligomers are also
immunogenic (Fauth et al., 1998; Souza et al., 2017). Recog-
nition of these cell-wall-derived DAMPs resembles TLR2/
TLR4/TLR6-mediated recognition of degradation products
from extracellular matrix in mammals (Choi and Klessig,
2016). Indeed, the malectin-like domain Catharanthus roseus
RLK1-like (MLD-CrRLK1L) receptor THE1 and the class XII
LRR-RLK MIK2 (LRR-KISS) link cell wall disintegration to
defense activation (Hematy et al., 2007; Van der Does et al.,
2017). Notably, MIK2 also acts as part of the receptor com-
plex in the pollen tube for the DEFENSIN-LIKE peptide
AtLURE1, a female guidance signal from the synergid cells
(Wang et al., 2016b). Whether AtLURE1-like peptides or the
aforementioned carbohydrate DAMPs provide ligands for
these cell wall integrity sensors requires future investigation.
Several endogenous peptides act as DAMPs, after pro-
cessing from larger precursors and/or extracellular release
during herbivore or pathogen resistance (Yamaguchi and
Huffaker, 2011; Bartels and Boller, 2015). In tomato, the
18-amino-acid
jasmonic
acid-dependent systemic signaling leading to herbivore
resistance (Pearce et al., 1991; McGurl et al., 1992; Orozco-
Cardenas et al., 1993; Beloshistov et al., 2017). The lack of
an N-terminal
leader sequence in the precursor prosys-
temin implies passive systemin release upon tissue injury.
Hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys), 18-amino-acid
glycosylated peptides, also mediate herbivore defenses in
Solanaceous species (Pearce et al., 2009). In A. thaliana,
PIP1 and PIP2 amplify MAMP-induced defenses via the
class XI LRR-RLK RLK7 in a manner dependent on BAK1
(Hou et al., 2014).

peptide

Plant elicitor peptides (Peps), including AtPep1-AtPep8
in A. thaliana and ZmPep1 in maize, are among the best-
characterized DAMPs in plants (Yamaguchi and Huffaker,
2011; Bartels and Boller, 2015). Elicitor-active Pep epitopes
are embedded in the C-terminus of PROPEP precursors,
and recognized by the class XI LRR-RLKs PEPR1/PEPR2 in
A. thaliana. The Pep-PEPR system contributes to broad-
spectrum resistance against bacteria, fungi, oomycetes,
nematodes and insects, and systemic immunity (Huffaker
et al., 2006, 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Tintor et al., 2013; Ross
et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2017). The lack of an N-terminal lea-
sequence implies membrane damage-dependent
der
release of PROPEPs (or derived DAMPs). Indeed, AtPRO-
PEP3 release and apparent processing is enhanced in the
presence of virulence effectors and/or host cell death dur-
ing Pst challenge (Yamada et al., 2016c). Notably, however,
AtPROPEP3 is also released following sterile AtPep1 appli-
cation, albeit without apparent processing. Given PEPR
requirements for MAMP responses (Ma et al., 2012; Tintor

interleukin 1L-1b in
tional secretion, as described for
humans (Malhotra, 2013). Although conserved in angios-
perms, Peps from a particular plant species are only recog-
nized in plants of the same family, pointing to the family-
level diversiﬁcation of recognition speciﬁcities (Huffaker
et al., 2011, 2013; Lori et al., 2015).

RECOGNITION OF COMMON PATTERNS ACROSS
KINGDOMS

In mammals, ﬂagellin is recognized by the extracellular
and intracellular PRRs TLR5 and NLRC4,
respectively
(Hayashi et al., 2001; Kofoed and Vance, 2011; Zhao et al.,
2011). The ﬂagellin site recognized by TLR5 is apart from
ﬂg22, although it partially overlaps with ﬂgII-28 (Yoon
et al., 2012). The diversiﬁcation of ﬂagellin patterns and
receptors points to convergent evolution of ﬂagellin per-
ception between plants and mammals (Ausubel, 2005).
Intriguingly, muramyl dipeptides, breakdown products of
PGNs, trigger immune response in metazoans, but not in
A. thaliana (Gust et al., 2007). Several classes of PRRs
including TLRs
mediate PGN recognition in metazoans,
and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
(NOD) receptors (Guan and Mariuzza, 2007). All
these
receptors are again unrelated in structure to plant PGN
receptors described above. LPS perception systems are
also diverged between plants and mammals. The extracel-
lular (TLR4 and CD14) and intracellular (caspase-11) recep-
tors in mammals and LORE all recognize the lipid A moiety
of LPS. However, their LPS recognition is differentially
inﬂuenced by LPS acylation patterns: hexa-acylated LPS
from E. coli fails to activate LORE but strongly activates
TLR4, while in contrast penta-acylated LPS from the human
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activates LORE signal-
ing, but not TLR4 or caspase-11 (Tan and Kagan, 2014;
Ranf et al., 2015). Furthermore, unlike in plants, no genuine
chitin receptor has been identiﬁed in mammals, although
TLR2, Dectin-1 and the mannose receptor have been impli-
cated in chitin-induced immune responses (Bueter et al.,
2013). These ﬁndings strengthen the view that lineage-speci-
ﬁc PRRs, arisen through convergent evolution, often recog-
nize distinct patterns from common microbial components
in plants and animals.

Like mammals, plants seem to recognize RNA and
DNA patterns from both microbe- and host-origins
(Huang et al., 2016). BAK1 and SERK1 mediate antiviral
immunity and PTI-like responses to double-strand RNA
(dsRNA), respectively (Korner et al., 2013; Niehl et al.,
2016). The LRR-RLK NIK1 (related to BAK1) also con-
tributes to antiviral
immunity and identiﬁes a virulence
for begomovirus (Santos et al., 2010; Zorzatto
target
et al., 2015), pointing to cell surface perception of viral
patterns. Whether and if so how this is linked to RNA
(DCL)-mediated dsRNA
silencing following dicer-like

Pattern recognition receptors in plants 599

detection represents an interesting question in antiviral
immunity.

Mammals recognize DNA-derived patterns through the
endosomal TLR9 and the cytoplasmic cyclic GMP-AMP
synthase-STING systems (Gallucci and Maffei, 2017).
Plants may also employ PRR(s) to perceive extracellular
DNA (eDNA), as eDNA induces PTI-like defenses and
pathogen resistance (Wen et al., 2009; Duran-Flores and
Heil, 2014, 2015; Mazzoleni et al., 2015; Gallucci and Maffei,
2017). Of note, substantial amounts of DNA are secreted
from plant roots, and inﬂuence both plants and microbes
in the soil (Ceccherini et al., 2009; Driouich et al., 2013).
eDNA serves as a nutrient source (Paungfoo-Lonhienne
et al., 2010), but also causes plant growth inhibition in a
conspeciﬁc manner (Mazzoleni et al., 2015). Plant eDNA
may act as DAMPs, to indicate life-threatening conditions
to the same (or closely related) plant species (Veresoglou
et al., 2015).

CELLULAR AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OUTPUTS AND
SIGNALING EVENTS DURING PTI

Perception of distinct patterns via cognate PRRs leads to a
stereotypic set of intracellular signaling events and defense
responses, which collectively contribute to the establish-
ment of PTI. Hence, these PTI-hallmark outputs provide
useful proxies to assess the strength and effectiveness of
PRR signaling. They include changes in ion-ﬂuxes across
the plasma membranes (PMs), increases in cytosolic Ca2+
and apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, which
are followed by production of phytohormones such as
ethylene and salicylic acids (SA), stomatal closure, callose
deposition, transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming
(Boller and Felix, 2009; Yu et al., 2017; Figure 1). A large
number of genes are commonly up- or downregulated in
response to different MAMPs/DAMPs (Zipfel et al., 2006;
Gust et al., 2007; Denoux et al., 2008; Wan et al., 2008;
Ross et al., 2014). These ﬁndings may imply that PRRs
merely represent separate entry points to PTI. However,
PRR pathways display notable diversiﬁcation in the
defense outputs and/or regulatory modes (see below).

cytosolic Ca2+

Immediately after pattern recognition, induced is a rapid
([Ca2+]cyt)
increase of
(Lecourieux et al., 2002; Seybold et al., 2014; Yuan et al.,
2017), which is required for a vast majority of PTI-charac-
teristic outputs (Jeworutzki et al., 2010; Kwaaitaal et al.,
2011; Ranf et al., 2011). Ca2+ pumps/channels mediating
Ca2+ inﬂux from the apoplasm and release from the inter-
nal stores need to be deﬁned (Klusener et al., 2002; Sey-
bold et al., 2014; Thor and Peiter, 2014; Yuan et al., 2017).
Cyclic nucleotide gated channel2 (CNGC2) and ionotropic
glutamate receptor-like channels (iGluR) are required for
LPS/Pep1- and ﬂg22/elf18/chitin-induced [Ca2+]cyt bursts,
respectively (Ali et al., 2007; Qi et al., 2010; Kwaaitaal

et al., 2011). However, their contributions are marginal to
ﬂg22-induced [Ca2+]cyt oscillation of guard cells (Thor and
Peiter, 2014), suggesting the context-speciﬁc employment
of different Ca2+ channels/pumps. Ca2+-ATPase8 (ACA8)
and ACA10 associate with FLS2 and are required for ﬂg22-
induced defenses, but not that of chitin (Frei dit Frey et al.,
2012). Physical and functional association of ACA8/ACA10
with BRI1 and the CLE peptide receptor CLV1 implies their
broad assignment to LRR-RLKs.

Extracellular alkalinization and PM depolarization are
detectable shortly after pattern recognition. PM-resident
H+-ATPases (AHAs) mediate H+ efﬂux from cytosol
to
establish the PM potential
in resting cells, but pattern-
induced AHA inactivation allows H+ inﬂux down the elec-
trochemical gradient. Together with increases in Cl(cid:1) and K+
efﬂuxes, this results in extracellular alkalinization (Jewor-
utzki et al., 2010; Elmore and Coaker, 2011). In A. thaliana,
dephosphorylation at two residues and phosphorylation at
Ser 899 of AHA, promoting and inhibiting AHA activity
respectively, occur during PTI (Benschop et al., 2007; Nuhse
et al., 2007). Pattern recognition also involves the endoge-
nous RALF peptides and their receptor, the MLD-CrRLK1L
FERONIA (FER) (Pearce et al., 2001; Haruta et al., 2008,
2014). FER phosphorylation of AHA2 at Ser 899 results in
AHA2 inactivation and thus extracellular alkalinization (Fig-
ure 2a; Haruta et al., 2014). By contrast, constitutive AHA
activation blocks extracellular alkalinization and stomatal
closure in response to ﬂg22, an important PTI defense
against microbial invasion (Liu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2015).
AHA activation is also among the mechanisms by which
RIN4, a guardee of the NLRs RPM1 and RPS2, attenuates
PTI (Liu et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2015). Given the extensive
reliance on PM-associated proteins, the impact of changes
in the PM potential on PTI can be enormous, an interesting
hypothesis remaining to be tested.

(cid:1))
Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion (O2
and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), serve not only as antimicro-
bial and cell-wall cross-linking agents, but also as signaling
molecules (Wrzaczek et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2017). Pattern-
induced apoplastic ROS production requires the NADPH
oxidase RBOHD (sufﬁcient for the ﬁrst ROS burst within
1–2 min) and the peroxidases PRX33/34 (Nuhse et al.,
2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Daudi et al., 2012; Kadota et al.,
2014). RBOHD is subject to Ca2+-dependent and -indepen-
dent regulations during PTI (Kadota et al., 2015). Although
the signiﬁcance of direct Ca2+ binding is unclear, RBOHD
phosphorylation by Ca2+-dependent protein kinases
(CDPKs), namely CPK5, CPK6, CPK11 and CPK4, leads to
RBOHD activation (Ogasawara et al., 2008; Boudsocq et al.,
2010; Dubiella et al., 2013). ROS also increase [Ca2+]cyt and
CPK5 activity (Dubiella et al., 2013). In addition, BIK1 phos-
phorylation of RBOHD further promotes RBOHD activation
(Kadota et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014b). Notably, CPK5 and
BIK1 phosphorylate RBOHD at distinct sites, and additively

promote RBOHD activation. BIK1/PBL1 also promote a
[Ca2+]cyt burst
(Li et al., 2014b; Ranf et al., 2014) and
RBOHD association with the heterotrimeric G-proteins
composed of XLG2, AGB1 and AGG1/AGG2 (Liang et al.,
2016), thereby ensuring RBOHD activation. The G-proteins
in turn mediate stable accumulation of BIK1. These ﬁnd-
ings illuminate positive feedback ampliﬁcation between
Ca2+, ROS and BIK1/PBLs, which can strengthen PTI signal-
ing. By contrast, CPK28 attenuates PTI signaling by phos-
phorylating BIK1, which leads to proteasomal BIK1
degradation (Monaghan et al., 2014). The RLCK PBL13
association with RBOHD also negatively inﬂuences ROS
production (Lin et al., 2015). As such, ﬁne-tuning individual
RLCK activity and balancing opposing functions of
different RLCK members underlie tight control of ROS
production.

Separate RLCK members are assigned between LRR-
largely reﬂecting RLCK
and LysM-domain PRR classes,
phosphorylation preference between BAK1 (for BIK1) and
CERK1 (for PBL27). BIK1 and closely related PBL1 play a
critical role in FLS2, EFR and PEPR signaling (Lu et al.,
2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013). The RLCKs PBS1,
PBL2, BSK1 and PCRK1/PCRK2 also function with FLS2
(Zhang et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2013; Sreekanta et al., 2015;
Kong et al., 2016), which explains the retention of some
FLS2 signaling outputs in bik1 pbl1 plants (Zhang et al.,
2010; Feng et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2013; Ranf et al., 2014).
In rice, OsRLCK176 and OsRLCK185 function with OsCERK1
in response to chitin and PGN (Yamaguchi et al., 2013). In
A.
thaliana, chitin induces CERK1 phosphorylation of
PBL27, orthologous to OsRLCK185, and in turn PBL27
phosphorylation of MAPKKK5 (Shinya et al., 2014; Yamada
et al., 2016b). Thus, PBL27 deﬁnes a direct link between
the LYK5/LYK4-CERK1 chitin receptor complex and a MAPK
cascade consisting of MAPKKK5-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6
(Yamada et al., 2016b). On the other hand, BIK1/PBLs are
likely to connect BAK1-associated PRRs to MAPK cascades.
Although BIK1/PBL1
FLS2/EFR-
mediated MAPK activation (Zhang et al., 2010), this can be
attributable to redundancy between RLCK members.
Indeed, the Xanthomonas campestris effector AvrAC inhi-
bits BIK1 and related PBLs, thereby suppressing MAPK
activation in response to ﬂg22 (Feng et al., 2012).

for

In A. thaliana, PRR signaling involves two major MAPK
cascades: one with an unknown MAPKK-kinase, MKK4/
MKK5 (MAPK kinase) and MPK3/MPK6 (MAPK); and the
other with MAPKKK8 (MEKK1), MKK1/MKK2 and MPK4/
MPK11 (Meng and Zhang, 2013). A growing number of
MAPK substrates have been described in PTI. MPK3/MPK6
phosphorylation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid

VIP1 (Djamei et al., 2007; Bethke et al., 2009;
et al., 2011; Mao et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2015). MPK3/
MPK6 phosphorylation targets a subclass of VQ-motif-con-
taining proteins (VQPs),
including VQ4, for degradation
(Pecher et al., 2014). As a consequence, WRKY TFs are
de-repressed from VQ4-mediated sequestration. Likewise,
VQ21 (MKS1) brings together WRKY33 and MPK4, thereby
having WRKY33 release dependent on MPK4 phosphoryla-
tion of VQ21 (Qiu et al., 2008). Moreover, MPK3/MPK6
phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase Cs (CDKCs),
and subsequent CDKC phosphorylation of RNA poly-
merase II C-terminal domain directly mediate transcrip-
tional activation of defense-related genes (Li et al., 2014a).
MPK3/MPK6 and MPK4 also inﬂuence mRNA quality con-
trol in the cytoplasmic processing bodies, by phosphorylat-
ing the mRNA-binding proteins TZF9
and PAT1,
respectively (Maldonado-Bonilla et al., 2014; Roux et al.,
2015). Conversely, MPK3 phosphorylation of PUB22 inhi-
bits its auto-ubiquitination and degradation, thereby stabi-
lizing this negative regulator for PTI attenuation (Furlan
et al., 2017). ﬂg22-induced MPK4 phosphorylation of the
transcriptional repressor ASR leads to suppression of
defense-related genes (Li et al., 2015a). Furthermore,
expression proﬁling in mpk mutants revealed previously
unsuspected complex roles for MPK3 and MPK4 in ﬂg22-
induced transcriptional reprogramming (Frei dit Frey et al.,
2014). Together, MAPK cascades both positively and nega-
tively regulate transcriptional reprogramming during PTI.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades undergo
cross-regulations between themselves and with other
defense pathways. MAPKKK5 inversely inﬂuences chitin-
and ﬂg22-responses:
loss of MAPKKK5, which mediates
MPK3/MPK6 activation in the CERK1-PBL27 phospho-relay,
enhances ﬂg22-induced MPK3/MPK6 activation (Yamada
et al., 2016b). MAPKKK7 physically associates with FLS2
and attenuates ﬂg22-induced defenses, via a process that
remains elusive (Mott et al., 2016). Moreover, the secreted
proteases PrpL and ArgC from the bacterial pathogens
induce
P. aeruginosa and X. campestris,
MAPK activation in a distinct mode (Cheng et al., 2015).
This requires heteromeric G-proteins composed of AGB1,
GPA1 and AGG1/AGG2, and the conserved scaffold protein
RACK1, which associates with MEKK1, MKK5, MPK3 and
MPK6, but not MPK4. However, the G-proteins and RACK1
are dispensable for MPK3/MPK6 activation in response to
ﬂg22. The requirement
for PrpL/ArgC catalytic activity
implies the possible involvement of DAMPs in this
regulation.

Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and MAPKs act in paral-
lel or concert to mediate transcriptional reprogramming
during PTI (Boudsocq et al., 2010). PTI-inducible genes are
classiﬁed into MAPK-speciﬁc, MAPK-dominant, synergisti-
cally regulated and CDPK-speciﬁc genes (Boudsocq et al.,
2010). CDPK- and MAPK-mediated transcriptional regulations

can be also antagonistic or complementary to each other.
When [Ca2+]cyt bursts are impaired with aca8 aca10 mutation
or iGluR inhibition, ﬂg22 induction of CDPK-speciﬁc target
genes is lowered but that of MAPK-speciﬁc target genes is
enhanced (Kwaaitaal et al., 2011; Frei dit Frey et al., 2012).
Identiﬁcation of CDPK substrates will help elucidate the
underlying mechanisms.

In rice, the small GTPase OsRac1 also provides a link
between OsCERK1 and downstream signaling. The Rac
GDP/GTP exchange factor 1 (OsRacGEF1) identiﬁes another
important substrate of OsCERK1 during chitin-triggered
signaling (Akamatsu et al., 2013). Phosphorylated OsRac-
GEF1 activates and involves OsRac1 to trigger ROS produc-
tion through direct association with OsRBOHB, thereby
mediating fungal resistance (Ono et al., 2001; Wong et al.,

FUNCTIONAL DIVERGENCE AND SIGNAL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN PRR PATHWAYS

Pattern recognition receptor pathways display substantial
divergence in their sensitivity to biotic or abiotic perturba-
tions. For instance, compared with EFR and XA21, FLS2
and PEPR1/PEPR2 better tolerate dysfunction of N-glycosy-
lation-dependent ER quality control (QC; Tintor and Saijo,
2014). The ERQC pathway is also required for SOBIR1 func-
tion and autoimmunity in bir1 and bak1 serk4 plants, but
not or less for BAK1 function or plant development (Sun
et al., 2014; Tintor and Saijo, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015a; de
Oliveira et al., 2016). These ﬁndings suggest that an ERQC
pathway is speciﬁcally employed for a large subset of cell
surface defense regulators in plants. Moreover, BAK1-asso-
ciated PRRs are also diverged in BAK1 or BIK1 require-
ments. FLS2 strictly requires BAK1, in contrast to EFR or
PEPR1/PEPR2 that can promiscuously function with differ-
ent SERK members (Roux et al., 2011; Yamada et al.,
2016c). On the other hand, PEPR1/PEPR2 strictly require
BIK1/PBL1 (Feng et al., 2012; Yamada et al., 2016c), while
FLS2 is less vulnerable to the loss of them. Even within sin-
gle PRR pathways, separate defense outputs often differen-
tially require SERK or RLCK family members (Tang et al.,
2017). Hence, simultaneous activation of these PRR path-
ways that are diverged in rate-limiting steps is likely to
increase the robustness of overall PTI signaling against
pathogen assaults. This is relevant in natural infections,
wherein plants are exposed to mixtures of MAMPs/DAMPs
(Aslam et al., 2009). Interestingly, substantial variations in
ﬂg22 or elf18 responsiveness are present across A. thaliana
accessions, which are mostly uncorrelated with each other

and attributable to different genetic loci
2016). It is conceivable that different PRRs have indepen-
dently diversiﬁed their functions and/or regulations within
or among natural plant populations, thereby facilitating
plant adaptation to different habitats and microbiota
thereof.

Pattern-triggered immunity is mounted in coordination
between different PRR pathways and with other physiolog-
ical processes. Additive or synergistic effects are often
seen following simultaneous and/or sequential application
of different patterns (Gust et al., 2017). This is often the
case for DAMPs: cutin, cellobiose, PIPs, Peps and RALF17
enhance MAMP-triggered defenses (Fauth et al., 1998; Bar-
tels et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2014; Souza et al., 2017; Steg-
mann et al., 2017). Conversely, ﬂg22/elf18 pretreatment
enhances Pep1-induced ROS production (Flury et al.,
2013). These data are compatible with the view that coinci-
dental detection of DAMPs in addition to MAMPs is indica-
tive of pathogenesis and strongly triggers host defense
activation (Escamilla-Tilch et al., 2013; Stuart et al., 2013).

functional

Importantly,

interactions between different
PRRs also occur in a layered manner. Pattern recognition
often leads to further induction of DAMPs or their precur-
sors (Gust et al., 2017). More importantly, perturbations of
MAMP signaling at different key steps are linked to the
activation or sensitization of another defense layer at both
the local and systemic levels. This resembles the indirect
recognition mode of ETI activation, but differs from ETI in
that speciﬁc effector recognition is not required (Couto and
Zipfel, 2016; Yasuda et al., 2017). For instance, BAK1 dys-
function is linked to de-repression of cell death and
autoimmunity (He et al., 2007; Kemmerling et al., 2007;
Wang et al., 2011; de Oliveira et al., 2016), via membrane-
resident PRR-like regulators and NLRs (Yasuda et al.,
2017). Depletion (not catalytic inactivation) of BAK1 leads
to sensitization of PEPR signaling toward SA-based
defenses (Figure 2b; Yamada et al., 2016c). This is critical
for basal resistance against Colletotrichum higginsianum,
infection.
which selectively depletes BAK1 during initial
However, Pst selectively targets a MAMP-induced active
pool of BAK1 with the effector HopB1, without discernible
counter-activation of
the back-up defenses (Li et al.,
2016a). Likewise, dysfunction of key PTI components,
including BIK1, RBOHD, the MPK4 cascade and the callose
synthase PMR4, is linked to enhanced resistance against
virulent pathogens (Nishimura et al., 2003; Kim et al.,
2005; Zhang et al., 2010, 2012; Laluk et al., 2011; Kong
et al., 2012; Kadota et al., 2014; Roux et al., 2015).

Antagonistic effects are also seen in certain pattern com-
binations, for instance, between OG and ﬂg22/elf18 in ROS
and [Ca2+]cyt bursts (Aslam et al., 2009), between chitin and
ﬂg22 in MPK3/MPK6 activation (Yamada et al., 2016b), and
between RALF23/33/34 and ﬂg22/elf18/chitin/RALF17 (Steg-
mann et al., 2017). They may reﬂect competition for

signaling components or cellular resources. The biological
signiﬁcance and the underlying mechanisms require fur-
ther investigation.

FER has pleiotropic roles in plant growth and develop-
ment (Tavormina et al., 2015), as the receptor for RALF
peptides including immuno-stimulatory and immuno-
repressible members (Figure 2a).
Immuno-repressible
RALFs act through FER to restrict ligand-induced FLS2/EFR-
BAK1 association (Stegmann et al., 2017). Reﬂecting this
complexity, loss of FER enhances powdery mildew fungal
resistance (Kessler et al., 2010), but lowers MAMP-induced
ROS production and Pst resistance (Stegmann et al., 2017).
Fine control of immune responses through RALF peptides
of opposing functions resembles that of pro- and anti-
inﬂammatory cytokines in mammals (Banchereau et al.,
2012). The MLD-CrRLK1L IOS1 constitutively associates
with FLS2, EFR, BAK1 and CERK1, and promotes FLS2-
BAK1 association, suggesting that IOS1 provides a scaffold
for PRR complexes of different ectodomain classes (Yeh
et al., 2016). PRR homo-oligomerization or larger complex
formation involving two or more PRRs may occur at such
cell-surface scaffolds (Sun et al., 2012). The glycosylphos-
phatidylinositole-anchored protein LLG1, a co-receptor for
FER (Li et al., 2015b), constitutively associates with FLS2/
EFR to ensure FLS2 accumulation and signaling, but is dis-
pensable for FLS2-BAK1 association (Shen et al., 2017).
Notably, in llg1-3 allele, FLS2 signaling control is uncou-
pled from that of receptor accumulation. EFR signaling
control is also uncoupled from EFR abundance control in
weakly dysfunctional alleles of ERQC components (Lu
et al., 2009; Saijo et al., 2009). Together with advances in
PRR signaling mechanisms, it is interesting to address the
causal relationship between receptor folding, localization
and signaling functions on the cell surface scaffolds.

A well-documented tradeoff between immunity and
growth also inﬂuences PTI signaling (Belkhadir et al.,
2014). For instance, FLS2-mediated PTI signaling and BRI1-
mediated BR signaling antagonize each other (Lozano-
Duran and Zipfel, 2015). Among the shared signaling com-
ponents between the two pathways, at least BAK1 and
BSK1 are not the limiting factor for such tradeoff (Lozano-
Duran et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2013). However, while BIK1
positively regulates FLS2 signaling, BIK1 negatively regu-
lates BR signaling through phosphorylation of BRI1 (Lin
et al., 2013). Conversely, the BR-responsive TFs BZR1 and
HBI1 attenuate PTI signaling (Lozano-Duran et al., 2013;
Fan et al., 2014; Malinovsky et al., 2014). Another example
involves FLS2/EFR and the LRR-RLKs PSKRs and PSY1R,
which recognize growth-promoting Tyr-sulfated peptides
PSKs and PSY1, respectively (Matsubayashi and Sakagami,
2006; Amano et al., 2007). MAMP responses and bacterial
and fungal resistance are negatively correlated with the
dose of PSKs, PSY1R and/or Tyr protein sulfotransferase
that activates PSKs (Igarashi et al., 2012; Mosher et al.,

Enforced PRR activation typically results in seedling
growth inhibition (Boller and Felix, 2009). The secreted
peptide CLE14 is perceived not only by the LRR-RLP CLV2
but also by PEPR2 under
low-phosphate conditions,
thereby inducing full differentiation of the root meristem
and growth arrest of the primary root (Gutierrez-Alanis
et al., 2017). It is interesting to test possible inﬂuences of
CLE14 on PEPR2-mediated defense signaling.

Signal attenuation mechanisms of PRRs are exploited by
pathogens to subvert PTI. Fungal pathogens secrete func-
tional homologs of RALF peptides to manipulate host
physiology and immunity (Masachis et al., 2016; Thynne
et al., 2017; Figure 2a). Their recognition by FER leads to
invasive
extracellular
hyphal growth and fungal virulence (Di Pietro et al., 2001;
Prusky and Yakoby, 2003), and also leads to the suppres-
sion of PTI (Masachis et al., 2016).

PRR-MEDIATED CONTROL OF BENEFICIAL AND
COMMENSAL MICROBES

Symbiotic microbes also exploit cross-regulations between
host PRR pathways. There is a high degree of overlap
between symbiotic and immune signaling (Antolin-Llovera
et al., 2014; Zipfel and Oldroyd, 2017). Similar constraints
are imposed by the host immunity on mutualistic and
pathogenic microbes, which include PTI, i.e. elicitor-inac-
tive ﬂg22 alleles in nitrogen-ﬁxing rhizobacteria (Gomez-
Gomez et al., 1999) and ﬂg22-induced suppression of their
colonization (Lopez-Gomez et al., 2012), and ETS/ETI, i.e.
NLR-dependent rhizobacterial resistance (Yang et al., 2010)
and bacterial effector-mediated promotion or restriction of
symbiosis (Marchetti et al., 2010; Okazaki et al., 2013; Tsu-
kui et al., 2013; Gourion et al., 2015; Yasuda et al., 2016).
Given the shared host requirements between arbuscular
mycorrhizal (AM) and root nodule symbioses (Bonfante
and Genre, 2010; Oldroyd, 2013), the similar principles
may broadly apply to mutualistic fungi (Plett and Martin,
2015).

Nodule symbiosis relies on host-speciﬁc recognition of
microbial
lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), designated
NOD factors (Cullimore et al., 2001; Bek et al., 2010), via

(Broghammer et al., 2012). NOD factor perception induces

tion, NOD factors or chitin oligomers (C4/C5) reduce ﬂg22-
induced defenses in soybean (Liang et al., 2013). Notably,
this PTI suppression also occurs in A. thaliana that lacks
nodule and AM symbioses, through the LysM-RLK AtLYK3
(Figure 2c).
In addition to the successful evasion from
FLS2 recognition (Gomez-Gomez et al., 1999), rhizobacteria
induce FLS2/EFR degradation with NOD factors.

Pattern recognition receptors in plants 603

Lipo-chitooligosaccharides and chitin oligosaccharides

trigger mycorrhization-associated
responses (Maillet et al., 2011; Genre et al., 2013), through
LjNFR1/MtLYK3, LjNFR5/MtNFP and related LysM-RLKs,
although LjNFR5/MtNFP is dispensable for AM symbiosis
(Zhang et al., 2015b; Zipfel and Oldroyd, 2017). Notably,
LjNFR1/MtLYK3 are orthologous to OsCERK1, which has a
dual role in promoting AM symbiosis and chitin-induced
immunity in rice. These CERK1 orthologs may act as a
common co-receptor for mycorrhizal signals as well as
chitin or PGNs. Consistent with this notion, evidence
suggests a positive role for LjNFR1 and MtNFP in plant
immunity (Nakagawa et al., 2011; Rey et al., 2013). The
MLD-CrRLK1L SYMRK, a common requirement for nodule-
and AM-symbioses (Stracke et al., 2002), may provide a
signaling scaffold. Remarkably, ligand-speciﬁc activation of
defense or symbiosis via the shared (co)receptor also
occurs in mammals: TLR2 mediates immune activation
and suppression in response to pathogen-derived ligands
and gut bacterial ligands, respectively (Round et al., 2011).
In the case of CERK1, in addition to the ligand speciﬁcities
of the paired receptors (Bozsoki et al., 2017), the Tyr-Ala-
Gln/Arg motif in the CERK1 kinase domain provides a criti-
cal determinant for the competence of symbiotic signaling
(Nakagawa et al., 2011; Miyata et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2014). Further insight into this signal sorting will shed light
on the decisive mechanisms that selectively activate sym-
biotic or immune signaling.

Phylogenetic studies propose that perception of mycor-
rhizal LCOs is an ancestral function for that of chitin or NOD
factors (De Mita et al., 2014). The loss of the micorrhization-
associated CERK1 motifs in non-micorrhizal plant lineages
may reﬂect the antagonistic relationship between symbiotic
and defense signaling. Indeed, in A. thaliana, the CERK1-
interacting (class VIII) LRR-RLK LIK1 negatively inﬂuences
chitin/ﬂg22-triggered defenses (Le et al., 2014). Some ﬁla-
mentous pathogens exploit host symbiotic responses to
promote root infection (Wang et al., 2012; Rey et al., 2015).
These ﬁndings indicate that symbiotic microbes also con-
tribute to the evolution of the host PTI systems.

In nature, healthy plants accommodate endophytic
microbes without discernible defense activation or disease
symptoms. Recent studies point to a role for host PTI in
the selection and management of plant-associated micro-
bial communities (Hacquard et al., 2017).
In A. thaliana,
transcriptional reprogramming in response to an endo-
phytic bacterium displays a large overlap with that of Pst
challenge (Vogel et al., 2016), highlighting the similarity in
the host response between commensals and pathogens.
The majority of the A. thaliana root-associated bacteria
seem to lack elicitor-active ﬂg22/elf18 alleles, suggesting
that PTI evasion facilitates their colonization (Hacquard
et al., 2017). Indeed, PTI serves to prevent the overgrowth
of endophytic leaf bacteria under high humidity (Xin et al.,

2016). Moreover, virulence effector expression and/or
delivery are substantially reduced in the non-pathogenic
mode of bacterial and fungal colonization (Mohr et al.,
2008; Cesbron et al., 2015; Hacquard et al., 2016). These
ﬁndings are consistent with the idea that PTI plays a cen-
tral role in the establishment and maintenance of plant-
associated microbiomes.

complexes (Yamada et al., 2016a). This serves to deprive
bacteria of metabolizable sugars, and also to suppress the
type III secretion of virulence effectors. It is interesting to
determine the extent to which apoplastic sugar control
contributes to PTI-induced restriction of bacterial effector
delivery (Crabill et al., 2010) and also to the microbiome
homeostasis described above.

INTERPLAY BETWEEN PTI AND ENVIRONMENTAL
FACTORS

Environmental abiotic factors such as humidity, tempera-
tures and nutrients drastically inﬂuence disease incidence
and plant colonization by pathogenic and mutualistic
microbes (Scholthof, 2007; Cheng et al., 2013; Hacquard
et al., 2016; Wagner et al., 2016; Xin et al., 2016; Melotto
et al., 2017). Elucidation of functional links between plant
immunity, microbial
infection modes and environmental
conditions offers new avenues in PTI studies. In light of
the homeostatic nature of plant-associated microbial com-
munities, it is conceivable that their alterations are sensed
by PRRs as a signature of dis-homeostasis. This hypothesis
is related to the question of how MAMP ligands integrated
inside the microbial cells are presented to PRRs. In A. thali-
ana, PGN perception requires the host-derived hydrolase
LYS1 that releases soluble elicitor-active ligands (Liu et al.,
2014). EF-Tu and CSPs are both secreted from the bacterial
cytoplasm via an unknown process (Song et al., 2009). It
is important
to determine how MAMP presentation is
regulated, possibly depending on microbial growth status
or environmental conditions. Of particular note, PRR-
mediated defenses involve active control of the apoplastic
environment, by releasing ROS (and scavengers), hydroly-
tic enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, anti-microbial proteins and
compounds, which may lead to further generation of
MAMPs and DAMPs.

The availability for crucial and often limiting soil nutri-
ents such as phosphate or nitrogen also markedly inﬂu-
ences plant interactions with pathogenic, beneﬁcial and
commensal microbes (Parniske, 2008; Vega et al., 2015;
Hacquard et al., 2016; Castrillo et al., 2017). It is possible
that nutrient limitation represents signature of pathogene-
sis in plants (Mathioni et al., 2011), as changes in meta-
bolic states serve as DAMPs in metazoans (Gallo and
Gallucci, 2013; Gust et al., 2017). Nutrient status-dependent
modulation of PTI and the molecular link between nutrient
and microbial sensing will merit vigorous investigation.

Sugars produced by photosynthesis provide key nutrient
sources for numerous plant-infecting microbes, and their
apoplastic ﬂuxes are tightly regulated via the coordination
of cell-wall-bound invertases (cwINs) and sucrose trans-
porter proteins (STPs). PTI activation increases the uptake
of hexoses (produced from sucrose via cwINs) from the
apoplasm,
in part through the elevated expression and
BAK1-mediated phosphorylation of STP13 in the PRR

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND PERSPECTIVES

Substantial advances have been made toward a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms underlying PRR func-
tions, from extracellular recognition of MAMPs/DAMPs to
the regulation of
immune signaling that culminates in
pathogen resistance. It is also clear that an array of PRRs
of distinct properties, not only in ligand recognition speci-
ﬁcities but also in immune subfunctions and/or rate-limit-
ing regulatory steps, becomes engaged and collectively
contributes to robust PTI activation. However, it remains
poorly understood how plants accommodate beneﬁcial or
commensal microbes while maintaining plant immunity to
pathogenic microbes. Evidence indicates a critical role for
the proper control of endophytic or mutualistic microbes
in the establishment of beneﬁcial associations with them
(Lahrmann et al., 2015; Hiruma et al., 2016). Of note, the
same microorganisms can be beneﬁcial or pathogenic to
the host, depending on biological contexts. In line with
this, it is becoming apparent that plants employ a common
set of defense components to control both pathogenic and
non-pathogenic microbes. One important and challenging
question involves how plants integrate MAMP/DAMP sens-
ing with that of environmental cues to distinguish patho-
gens from non-pathogens in a context-dependent manner.
Moreover, homeostatic control of plant-associated micro-
biome is likely to represent an important function of PRRs,
which not only serve to sense but also to structure the
proximal environment to the plant. Further excitement cer-
tainly awaits us in plant PRR studies.
