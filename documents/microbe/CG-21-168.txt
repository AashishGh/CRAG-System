Abstract: Plant-microbe interactions are both symbiotic and antagonistic, and the knowledge of both 
these interactions is equally important for the progress of agricultural practice and produce. This re-
view  gives  an  insight  into  the  recent  advances  that  have  been  made  in  the  plant-microbe  interaction 
study  in  the  post-genomic  era  and  the  application  of  those  for  enhancing  agricultural  production. 
Adoption  of  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  and  marker  assisted  selection  of  resistant  genes  in 
plants, equipped with cloning and recombination techniques, has progressed the techniques for the de-
velopment of resistant plant varieties by leaps and bounds. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
of both plants and microbes have made the selection of desirable traits in plants and manipulation of 
the genomes of both plants and microbes effortless and less time-consuming. Stress tolerance in plants 
has been shown to be accentuated by association of certain microorganisms with the plant, the study 
and  application  of  the  same  have  helped  develop  stress-resistant  varieties  of  crops.  Beneficial  mi-
crobes  associated  with  plants  are  being  extensively  used  for  the  development  of  microbial  consortia 
that  can  be  applied  directly  to  the  plants  or  the  soil.  Next-generation  sequencing  approaches  have 
made it possible to identify the function of microbes associated in the plant microbiome that are both 
culturable and non-culturable, thus opening up new doors and possibilities for the use of these huge 
resources of microbes that can have a potential impact on agriculture. 

Keywords:  Plant-microbe  interaction,  crop  improvement,  plant  immune  response,  GWAS,  plant  growth-promoting  bacteria, 
plant stress management. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

  The  population  of  the  world  in  December  2019,  as  re-
ported  by  the  United  Nations  through  the  Worldometer,  is 
7.8  billion,  and  it  is  increasing  exponentially.  Therefore, 
there is a dire need to meet the increasing demand for food, 
with enhancement in agricultural practices. This needs to be 
done in harmony with the ecological balance, which, in turn, 
translates to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides.  Agricultural  research  thus  needs  to  focus  on  al-
ternative  options  to  enhance  food  production.  Molecular 
study of plant-microbe interactions can be a better alternative 
for  sustainable  agriculture  [1].  Plants  live  together  with  dif-
ferent microorganisms that survive in the rhizosphere below 
the  ground  and  above  in  the  phyllosphere  [2,  3].  They  are 
present  within  the  plants  as  endophytes,  as  epiphytes  at-
tached to plant surface, and around the roots in the surround-
ing soil. These microorganisms may have positive, neutral or 
harmful  effects  on  the  health  and  development  of  plants

[4,  5].  The  mechanism  behind  plant-microbe  interaction  is 
still  not  completely  known  and  there  are  many  questions, 
which  need  to  be  answered.  These  queries  are  about  plant 
immune  response,  signaling  pathway  (in  both  plants  and 
microorganisms),  beneficial  and  harmful  interactions  be-
tween  plants  and  microorganisms,  etc.  These  queries  will 
help  us  understand  the  whole  mechanism  of  plant-microbe 
interaction  and  also  help  to  identify  those  microorganisms 
which  can  be  used  in  the  near  future  to  increase  crop  yield 
[6].  In  agriculture,  the  association  of  microbes  with  plants 
serves  as  a  catalyst  to  spontaneously  improve  yield  [7,  8]. 
Current  farming  activities,  which  rely  heavily  on  the  inten-
sive  use  of  high  yielding  agrochemicals,  often  cause  envi-
ronmental  hazards  [9].  The  consequences  of  drastic  global 
climate change, diminishing agricultural lands, rapid urbani-
zation,  and  widespread  use  of  agrochemicals,  have  had  a 
devastating  impact  on  crop  production  and  ecology  around 
the  world,  thus  prioritizing  the  need  for  eco-friendly  and 
sustainable  development  in  agriculture  [10].  An  important 
strategy  related  to  climate-smart  agricultural  practices  is  to 
harness the role of microorganisms in increasing plant nutri-
ent  quality  and  crop  yield  [11].  Beneficial  plant-microbe 
interactions  include  Plant  Growth  Promotion  (PGP),  biotic 
and  abiotic  stress  protection  by  plant  immune  system  prim-

ing or activating plant defense mechanisms; variable ecosys-
tem  adaptation,  mycorrhizal  symbiosis,  nutrient  uptake,  and 
plant-accessible  transfer  of  inaccessible  nutrient  sources 
have been summarized previously [12]. 

  Additionally,  emerging  plant  diseases  pose  a  serious 
threat to the world's agricultural industries, food safety, and 
plant species survival. Therefore, it is important to be able to 
quickly  identify  a  new  phytopathogen  and  explain-  “What 
factor  is  responsible?,  How  it  has  evolved?,  How  do  they 
interact with plant systems?”, to answer these questions, it is 
necessary  to  mine  and  annotate  the  genes  involved  in  the 
plant-microbe  associations  from  the  genomes  of  both  part-
ners. In this regard, DNA and RNA, genomics data analysis, 
transcriptomics,  metagenomics,  metabolomics,  NGS  tech-
niques, and proteomics methods have proved to be valuable 
tools for exploring plant-microbe interactions and their asso-
ciations [13, 14]. 

  The  key  proteins,  that  are  involved  in  the  growth  and 
development  of  plants,  and  stress  tolerance  (both  biotic  and 
abiotic), play a vital role in the maintenance of cellular func-
tions in the plants by controlling physiological and biochem-
ical pathways [15, 16]. Recent research in the post-genomic 
era showed that modern “omics” technologies emerged as an 
important tool for the discovery of new genes responsible for 
encoding a functional protein, which will be helpful in many 
crop advancement programs [17]. In this present review, we 
have  discussed  the  importance  of  plant-microbe  interaction 
for crop improvement and stress management, focusing spe-
cifically  on  the  advantages  of  NGS,  along  with  Genome-
Wide Association (GWA) mapping.  

2.  PLANT-MICROBE  INTERACTION  FOR  CROP 
ADVANCEMENT 

Sustainable crop production will be one of the key chal-
lenges  for  the  twenty-first  century.  Due  to  changes  in  the 
environment,  agriculture  production  has  been  severely  af-
fected and therefore, deployment of technologies for the en-
hancement of agricultural production is necessary to provide 
sufficient  food  for  the  growing  population.  Current  agricul-
ture  production  practices,  such  as  the  improper  use  of  syn-
thetic  pesticides  and  fertilizer,  create  a  long  list  of  environ-
mental and health problems, therefore, to optimize the use of 
plant-microbe  interaction  for  crop  production  is  one  of  the 
better alternatives [18]. Research has shown repeatedly over 
the  last  several  decades  that  bacteria  and  fungi  associate 
closely  with  their  host  plants  and  are  capable  of  fostering 
plant growth as well as suppressing plant pathogens [19-21]. 
Besides  these,  plant  biotechnology  has  contributed  to  the 
development of several new crop varieties by using molecu-
lar breeding and genetic engineering approach to transfer the 
resistance  genes  against  pathogens  with  greater  disease  re-
sistance,  enhance  nutrient  availability  and  uptake,  and  pro-
mote  biodiversity,  this  approach  is  most  effective  and  envi-
ronmentally  friendly  to  counter  microbial  diseases  as  op-
posed to the use of chemical pesticides [22-25]. In addition, 
emerging, re-emerging, and endemic plant pathogens contin-
ue  to  affect  agricultural  production,  hence,  to  tackle  these 
challenges, strategic measures should be taken in the agricul-
tural  management  system  [26].  One  of  the  strategies  is  the 
application of Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) 

in agriculture [27]. Large-scale application of PGPR to crops 
as inoculants has been proven to be beneficial in increasing 
crop yield, as it eventually leads to a reduction in the use of 
chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  which  pollute  the  envi-
ronment and contaminate food [28]. The recent development 
of  new  techniques  in  the  post-genomic  era  has  opened  new 
horizons  for  the  development  of  superior  or  novel  PGPR 
strains  with  enhanced  plant  growth  promotion  characteris-
tics; also, the development of transgenic crop plants express-
ing the PGPR gene has been developed with increased biotic 
and  abiotic  stress  resistance  [29].  In  recent  years,  various 
high-throughput ‘omics’ approaches have advanced biologi-
cal science; these approaches include genomics, the study of 
the structural and functional aspects of genes; and compari-
son  of  the  degree  of  gene  expression  in  contrasting  geno-
types,  transcriptomics  that  quantifies  mRNA  transcripts, 
proteomics  that  analyzes  the  protein  composition  and 
metabolomics  which  identifies  and  quantifies  cellular  me-
tabolites [30-32]. ‘Omics’ platforms are widely used in un-
derstanding  and  selecting  efficient  endophytic  or  beneficial 
strains with various improved traits such as nutrient uptake, 
imparting  abiotic  and  biotic  stress  tolerance  during  their 
interaction  with  plants  [33,  34].  Comparative  studies  by 
large-scale  genome  and  proteome  analysis  of  hosts  and 
pathogens have helped in the identification of various effec-
tor  genes,  key  proteins  and  the  nature  of  pathogenesis  in-
duced by pathogen and also the difference in defense mech-
anisms  elicited  by  the  plants  [35,  36].  Recent  research 
showed  that  ‘omics’  is  a  promising  tool  for  better  under-
standing of plant-microbe interaction and also the discovery 
of  new  genes  and  proteins,  which  will  be  helpful  in  crop 
advancement  for  sustainable  agriculture  [37-39].  Whole-
genome  sequence  analysis  of  Bacillus  aryabhattai  AB211 
was done using an Illumina platform, HiSeq Illumina paired-
end  technology,  with  151  bp  of  reads;  and,  the  study  per-
formed focused mostly on the plant-microbe interaction ele-
ments. This study confirmed the presence of signature genes 
for  plant  growth  promotion  in  AB211,  such  as,  chemotaxis, 
siderophore  production,  phosphate  solubilization,  metal  ion 
uptake, etc., which makes AB211 a potential candidate to be 
used  as  PGPR  [40].  Similarly,  other  NGS  projects  have 
been  undertaken  to  identify  strains  with  potential  PGPR 
properties,  for  example-  S.  marcescens  UENF-22GI  [41], 
Pantoeaagglomerans  strain  P5  [42],  PGPR  consortium  of 
Bacillus cereus AR156, Bacillus subtilis SM21, and Serratia 
sp. XY21 for sweet pepper disease suppression [43].  

3.  PLANT  DEFENSE  SYSTEMS  AGAINST  PATHO-
GENS 

Plants  are  in  constant  contact  with  microorganisms  that 
may be symbiotic or pathogenic. However, not all plants are 
infected or sick, because they have excellent defense mecha-
nisms  that  effectively  counteract  pathogen  attack.  A  patho-
gen can establish an infection in the plant only if the plant is 
susceptible and the environmental conditions favor the estab-
lishment  of  the  disease  [44].  Plant  immunity  is,  however, 
innate in nature and does not possess mobile immune cells or 
antibodies  [45].  The  defense  mechanism  in  plants  can  be 
broadly  categorized  as  (i)  constitutive-  which  includes  the 
physical and chemical barriers that are inherently present in 
the  plants,  but  none  the  less  act  as  the  first  line  of  defense; 

 
 
170    Current Genomics, 2020, Vol. 21, No. 3 

Agrahari et al. 

and (ii) induced which is the second line of defense response 
and  is  the  active  response  mounted  upon  the  perception  of 
pathogen attack by the plant [46]. The plant defense response 
has  explained  time  and  again  with  many  models  and  each 
model  accommodates  the  findings  of  that  era  in  which  the 
model or hypothesis was built. We are going to briefly give 
an overview of the different models and introduce the terms, 
concepts,  and  mechanisms  of  the  plant  defense  response 
(Fig. 1). Previously the genetic basis of plant-microbe inter-
action was described in the gene for gene hypothesis [47]. It 
suggests  that  obligate  parasites  and  hosts  evolve  parallelly, 
and  there  are  specific  resistance  (R)  genes  in  the  host  that 
match  specific  virulence  factors  (Avr)  in  the  pathogen.  The 
interaction of compatible R gene and Avr causes the plant to 
be resistant to the particular pathogen. On the other hand, the 
interaction  of  the  incompatible  R  gene  and  Avr  causes  the 
establishment  of  infection  by  the  pathogen.  The  zig-zag 
model was an extension of the gene for gene hypothesis and 
it proposed that plant immunity has two branches-(i) patho-
gen-associated  molecular  pattern  triggered  immunity  (PTI), 
and  (ii)  effector-triggered  immunity  (ETI)  [48].  Plant  cell 
surfaces  have  receptors  called  pattern  recognition  receptors 
(PRRs)  that  recognize  pathogen-associated  molecular  pat-
terns (PAMPs), also known as microbe-associated molecular 
patterns (MAMPs). PAMPs are specific pathogen signatures 
like the flg22 (a 22 amino acid peptide of the conserved fla-
gellin domain) [49], chitin of the fungal cell wall [50], elon-
gation  factor  EFTu  [51],  etc.  that  the  plant  cell  perceives 
through PRRs as non- self [48]. Pathogens also modify cer-
tain  plant  molecules,  e.g.,  oligogalactouronides  [52]  or  cel-
lobiose,  upon  infection  or  release  plant  molecules  like  ATP 
[53], NAPH, etc.; these molecules are perceived by the plant 
PRRs as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as 
described elaborately in the danger model [54]. The immune 
response  mounted  in  response  to  PAMPs  and  DAMPs  is 
called  the  Pattern  Triggered  Immunity  (PTI).  The  early  re-
sponses mounted in PTI include- closure of stomata, activa-
tion  of  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK)  cascades, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, callose deposition 
and  transcriptional  activation  of  resistance-related  genes 
[55]. PTI response is a moderate response and helps to pre-
vent  the  spread  of  the  pathogen  from  the  site  of  infection. 
Phytopathogens  that  are  capable  of  evading  the  PTI  inject 
effectors  through  sophisticated  machinery  like  the  type  III 
secretion  system  and  the  type  VI  secretion  system  into  the 
plant  cells  to  manipulate  the  plant  defense  response  mecha-
nism  [56].  The  plant  cells  then  respond  to  the  effectors  by 
mounting  the  effector-triggered  immunity  (ETI),  which  is 
categorized as a more severe reaction and mostly culminates 
in hypersensitivity response (HR) or programmed cell death. 
Apart  from  PTI  and  ETI,  pathogen  perception  by  the  host 
induces the production of a myriad of toxic substances, phe-
nolic  compounds,  phytoalexins,  proteins,  and  enzymes, 
which  help  to  inactivate  the  pathogen  enzymes  and  toxins. 
The  induced  plant  response  to  MAMPs  and  damage-
associated  molecular  patterns  (DAMPs)  perception  by  the 
receptors on the plant surface starts with the transphosphory-
lation  of  the  cytoplasmic  domains  of  the  receptors,  which 
finally leads to the cascade of chemical changes and changes 
in  the  transcriptional  regulation  in  the  host  plant  cell.  The 
chemical  response  induced  includes  increasing  alkalinity  of 
the growth medium by the release of H+, Ca2+, K+, Cl- ions. 

Alleviated Ca2+ levels are important for plant immunity as it 
triggers  salicylic  acid  (SA)  and  reactive  oxygen  species 
(ROS) production, and leads to stomatal closure. The chemi-
cals produced during ETI are SA, jasmonic acid-JA, ethylene 
and  various  antimicrobial  and  cell  wall  strengthening  com-
pounds. The SA produced binds to the NPR3 protein, which 
is  a  resistance  (R)  protein  and  mediates  the  degradation  of 
infected cells in a process called HR. HR is characterized by 
rapid cell death in and around the site of infection and stops 
the disease progression by the pathogen and is characterized 
by  disease  resistance  in  the  plants  [57].  Systemic  acquired 
resistance  (SAR)  is  similar  to  HR;  however,  it  involves 
translocation of the resistance to distance parts of the plants 
and involves plant hormones like SA, JA, ethylene, etc. Fur-
thermore, SAR results in prolonged resistance in plants to a 
broad range of pathogens [58]. The invasion model was then 
proposed  to  fill  the  lacunae  of  the  zig-zag  model;  in  this 
model, there is no dichotomy in the classification of PTI and 
ETI and the plant receptors and pathogen triggers. This mod-
el  broadly  categorizes  the  microbial  immunogenic  elicitors 
as  invasion  patterns  (IPs),  the  receptors  as  invasion  pattern 
receptors  (IPRs)  and  the  response  as  invasion  pattern  trig-
gered response (IPTRs) [59]. The latest model that has been 
proposed is called the spatial immunity model and is an en-
hancement  of  the  invasion  model;  in  this,  the  immunogenic 
response  has  been  categorized  on  the  basis  of  the  site  as- 
extracellular  triggered  response  (ExTR)  and  intracellular 
triggered  response  (InTR)  [60].  CRISPR-Cas-9  (Clustered 
regularly  interspaced  short  palindromic  repeats-  CRISPR-
associated protein 9) technology has been gaining increasing 
popularity  because  of  the  ease,  efficiency  and  reduced  cost 
of the technique. Development of disease-resistant plant va-
rieties is the new age eco-friendly response to the detrimental 
use  of  pesticides  and  chemicals  against  plant  pathogens. 
Traditional breeding techniques used for constructing disease 
resistant  crop  varieties  are  cumbersome,  time  taking  (some-
times extending for several years), and, have the drawback of 
undesirable  traits  being  accumulated  in  the  progeny  [61]. 
The  plant  immune  response  and  the  interaction  of  the  plant 
with  pathogens  are  an  extensive  field  of  research;  and  with 
the  new  advances  in  omics,  NGS  and  molecular  biology 
techniques,  new  approaches  for  developing  resistant  crop 
varieties  and  manipulation  of  the  pathogens  can  be  made 
possible  for  overall  crop  improvement.  Xanthomonaso-
ryzae.pv.oryzae  (Xoo)  is  the  causative  agent  of  bacterial 
blight (BB) and amounts to a 10-20% loss in rice yields [62]. 
Xoo  injects  TALEs  (transcription  activator-like  effectors ) 
through  the  type  III  secretion  apparatus  into  the  host  cell, 
TALEs  bind  to  specific  targets  regions  in  the  promoters  of 
the SWEET genes. SWEET genes are involved in the efflux 
of  sugars  out  of  the  plant  cells;  and  so,  by  upregulating  the 
expression  of  these  genes,  the  pathogen  creates  a  favorable 
environment  for  itself  for  the  establishment  of  the  disease. 
Researchers  used  CRISPR–Cas9-mediated  genome  editing 
technique  for  creating  mutations  in  the  SWEET  genes  of 
different  rice  varieties  and  through  field  trials  showed  that 
these  plants  displayed  robust,  broad-spectrum  resistance 
[63].  Apart  from  this,  various  studies  have  used  CRISPR–
Cas9  technology  for  building  resistant  varieties  of  different 
crops such as barley, wheat, tomato, banana, papaya, tomato, 
etc.  [62,  64].  Another  alternative  of  inducing  the  host  plant 
immune response has been the modification of the pathogens

to  make  it  avirulent  and  use  it  as  a  biocontrol  agent.  There 
have  been  studies  on  mutants  of  different  plant  pathogenic 
fungi that have attenuated virulence; moreover, when applied 
to  plants,  they  confer  plants  with  heightened  resistance  to  a 
broad  spectrum  of  diseases.  The  CRISPR/Cas-9  induced 
mutations  may  be  used  for  the  development  of  attenuated 
fungal avirulent strains [65]. Identification of novel resistant 
plant genes, the knowledge of which can be used for the de-
velopment of resistant crop varieties, has been recently stud-
ied through the proteomics approach. A comparative analysis 
of  the  proteome  of  the  xylem  sap  of  the  resistant  tomato 
plant  (with  R  gene-  I2);  and,  the  susceptible  tomato  plant 
with  the  endophyte-  Fusariumoxysporm  (that  confers  endo-
phyte mediated resistance) was done by nLC-MS/MS quanti-
fication of the proteome using MaxQuant software. This led 
to the enrichment of the protein PR5 in the plants, thus open-
ing doors for the overexpression of these proteins for confer-
ring resistance in plants that lack these resistance genes [66]. 
RNA-seq analysis of the resistant wild diploid banana varie-
ty-  Musa  acuminate  Pahang;  and,  the  triploid  susceptible 
cultivar Brazillian variety; against the Fusarium wilt disease 
pathogen - Fusarium oxysporm; provided significant insights 
into the resistant candidate genes in the wild resistant variety 
that play a potential role in the resistance and can be used as 
potential  candidates  for  building  resistant  banana  cultivars 
[43]. 

4. GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS) 
FOR  UNDERSTANDING  PLANT-MICROBE  INTER-
ACTIONS 

  The  quality  of  large-scale  comparative  genomics  in  the 
genomic  era  is  now  standard  practice  for  detecting  single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and evaluating their asso-
ciation with important phenotypes using GWAS. The GWAS 

approach  enables  the  statistical  determination  of  potential 
SNPs  over  a  population  of  individuals  with  a  shared  evolu-
tionary history [67]. GWAS is currently a powerful tool for 
detecting genomic regions associated with natural variations 
in disease resistance in both wild and cultivated plants (Fig. 
2) [68]. GWAS allows the correlation of traits in a genetical-
ly  diverse  population  by  utilizing  pre-existing  cumulative 
recombination  events  in  natural  populations.  However, 
GWAS  dependency  on  a  reference  genome  complicates  the 
recognition  of  sequences  such  as  resistance  (R)  genes,  that 
have greatly diverged from the reference. This limitation was 
overcome  by  conducting  trait-dependent  subsequences  (k-
mers) based genetics in combination with R gene enrichment 
sequencing  (AgRenSeq),  which  would  enable  the  discovery 
and cloning of R genes from a panel of plant diversity. The 
ability to rapidly clone agronomically important R genes by 
AgRenSeq  could  be  used  for  engineering  resistance  or  as 
specific  molecular  markers  for  use  in  breeding  programs 
[69].  

  Many plant-microbe interaction studies involved GWAS 
that focused on how a plant genotype influences interactions 
with a single microbial taxon in pairs [70, 71]. An aggregate 
of  340  accessions  of  japonica  and  indica  background  was 
evaluated by GWAS, which recognized 16 loci related with 
blast resistance, out of which two loci in japonica and a sin-
gle  locus  in  indica  were  significantly  associated  with  rice 
blast resistance [72]. A board of 162 rice cultivars from Af-
rican  nations  was  dissected  with  44  000  SNP  chip  and  31 
genomic  regions  were  found  related  to  rice  blast  resistance 
[73]. Plant GWAS has been shown to be effective in identi-
fying  genomic  locations  associated  with  disease  resistance, 
while  microbial  GWAS  reports  genomic  regions  associated 
with  pathogenicity,  but  these  studies  are  still  in  the  early 
stages.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  GWAS  mapping  was

never  carried  out  either  independently  or  jointly  on  the  two 
equivalents of the plant pathosystem. Characterizing the mo-
lecular  environment  of  plant-pathogen  interactions  will  sig-
nificantly  increase  our  knowledge  of  the  co-evolutionary 
processes leading to the acceptance of adaptive dynamics of 
plant  species 
thereby 
strengthening  our  understanding  and  forecasts  of  Emerging 
Diseases (ED) [76]. 

in  plant  communities  [74,  75], 

  On the other hand, plant pathogens GWASs are intended 
to  establish  the  genes  that  are  responsible  for  the  different 
phenotypes,  including  those  that  the  microbial  community 
modulates.  Current  research  on  pathogen  GWAS  found  in-
traspecific  variability  in  characteristics  such  as  aggressive-
ness  in  Fusarium  graminearum  (Fg),  a  widespread  fungal 
pathogen of wheat, barley, and maize. They used Restriction 
site-associated  DNA  sequencing  (RADseq)  method  to  per-
form  population  genomics  which  analyzes  213  pathogen 
isolates  from  13  German  field  populations  of Fg  and  found 
that  high  gene  flow  between  these  field  populations  would 
allow  this  pathogen  to  adapt  quickly  to  changes  in  its  envi-
ronment,  including  the  deployment  of  resistant  cultivars, 
applications of fungicides and a warming climate [77]. Dal-
man in 2013 used the GWA mapping method to classify the 
genetic  components  that  underlie  virulence  in  the  Hetero-
basidion annosum (Ha), a fungal necrotrophic pathogen that 
is  responsible  for  severe  damages  in  forest  conifers.  Based 
on  23  haploid  whole-genome  sequenced Ha isolates  collect-
ed  in  different  geographic  European  countries,  33,018  non-
singleton  SNPs  were  used  to  carry  out  GWA  mapping  on 
virulence  scored  on  both  Scots  pine  and  Norway  spruce  in 
controlled  condition;  in  both  host  species,  12  SNPs  are 
strongly associated with virulence [78]. In the study by Gao 
et  al.  (2016)  on  Phaeosphaeria  nodorum  (Pn),  191  isolates 
were phenotyped for virulence on two wheat lines and geno-
typed about 3,000 SNPs distributed throughout the genome, 

in  addition  to  genetic  markers  for  candidate  genes,  the  dis-
covery  SNP  of  two  previous  cloned  effector  genes  SnToxA 
and  SnTox3  showed  the  ability  of  GWA  mapping  in  Pn  to 
map  the  fine  virulence  factors  [79].  Recently,  a  hybrid  ap-
proach  of  GWA  mapping  and  comparative  genomics  has 
been  used  for  20  newly  sequenced  Puccinatriticina  isolates 
from  Australia,  based  on  306,474  SNPs,  a  polygenic  archi-
tecture  corresponding  to  302  genes  containing  at  least  one 
SNP associated with leaf rust virulence on wheat was identi-
fied [80]. In the future, more analysis is required to illustrate 
the  potential  of  GWAS  to  identify  novel  determinants  of 
virulence. Through advancements in NGS technology, DNA 
sequencing  has  become  an  attractive  alternative  to  genotyp-
ing SNP arrays, expanding GWAS beyond common variants 
and  keeping  the  possibility  of  identifying  rare  alleles  and 
structural  variations.  Genome  sequencing-based  strategy  for 
GWAS  has  found  wide-ranging  uses  in  rice  [81]  including 
crops, sorghum [82], foxtail millet [83], soybean [84], maize 
[85, 86], etc. In addition, combining GWAS and gene-based 
association analysis accompanied by haplotype analysis is a 
successful  means  of  identifying  candidate  genes  for  diverse 
traits  [87].  Furthermore,  GWAS  studies  and  related  experi-
mental  verification  should  be  performed  to  explore  the  re-
sistance  mechanism  and  susceptibility  mechanism  for  the 
plants, which will provide the new strategies for plant breed-
ing against the disease. 

5.  PLANT-MICROBE  INTERACTION  FOR  STRESS 
MANAGEMENT 

  Abiotic  and  biotic  stress,  which  directly  affects  crop 
productivity, soil health, and fertility, continually affects the 
agricultural  environment.  Abiotic  and  biotic  stress  can  be 
either natural or triggered by humans. Abiotic factors include 
drought, air pollution, low or high temperature, moisture and 
salinity, whereas biotic factors include fungi, bacteria, nema-

todes, and viruses. These stressors have a significant impact 
on plant physiological and metabolic changes and gene regu-
lation [88]. Many plants have the ability to alter gene expres-
sion and cope with these stresses through acclimatization and 
adaptation, while others cannot. One of the positive alterna-
tives is the deployment plant-associated microbial population 
such  as  mycorrhizal  fungi  and  plant  growth-promoting  bac-
teria  (PGPB),  which  help  plants,  grow  and  develop  under 
various abiotic and biotic stresses [89]. PGPB has been con-
sidered  a  cost-effective  and  environmentally  friendly  means 
of  disease  control  by  activating  the  cellular  component  and 
accumulating  secondary  metabolites  [90].  PGPR  has  been 
known to play an essential role in plant growth and metabo-
lism  in  order  to  rescue  plant  growth  in  stress  conditions. 
Most  PGPRs  contain  the  enzyme  1-aminocyclopropane  -1- 
carboxylate (ACC) deaminase and facilitate plant growth by 
sequestering and cleaving ACC, the immediate precursor of 
plant  hormone  ethylene,  thus  reducing  plant  ethylene  levels 
induced  by  stress  (cold)  [12].  PGPR,  such  as  Pseudomonas 
reactans, Chryseobacterium humi, improve soil productivity, 
and plant growth. PGPR have a competitive advantage over 
fungi for iron uptake due to the production of siderophores. 
Such  siderophores  have  a  very  high  affinity  for  iron;  iron–
siderophore complex can be taken up bacteria. By using this 
method,  PGPR  retard  pathogen  growth  by  reducing  iron 
availability  and  thus  protecting  the  plant  against  diseases 
[91]. Recent developments in plant biotechnology, including 
structural  and  functional  genomics,  can  provide  important 
tools  in  developed  and  developing  countries  for  agronomic 
improvement  and  also  for  stress  management,  for  example, 
the use of molecular markers has enabled the identification, 
mapping  and  transfer  of  many  disease  resistance  genes  into 
tomatoes  [92].  Moreover,  the  recent  advancement  of  NGS 
identified PGPRs genes that can be attributed to their ability 
to  improve  nutrient  availability,  suppress  pathogenic  fungi, 
resist  oxidative  stress,  quorum  sensing  and  ability  to  break 
down aromatic and toxic compounds and other abiotic stress 
[93]. Likewise, gene-editing tools such as Transcription acti-
vator-like  effector  nucleases (TALENs)  and  CRISPER-Cas 
have been described to control the pathogen interactions with 
plants to obtain modified plants [94]. 

  On the other hand, microbes such as Rhizobium, Bacillus, 
Pseudomonas, Methylobacterium, Variovorax, Enterobacter, 
etc.  have  been  reported  to  provide  tolerance  to  host  plants 
under  different  abiotic  stress  such  as  drought,  salinity,  etc. 
[95].  The  conditions  associated  with  drought  stress  are  lim-
ited water content, reduction in cell size, reduced membrane 
integrity,  production  of  reactive  oxygen  species  and  in-
creased  leaf  senescence,  which  lead  to  decreased  crop 
productivity. Microbes evolved, adapt or develop a tolerance 
mechanism  to  survive  under  low  water  potential.  They  may 
form  thick  walls  (Biofilm)  or  enter  the  dormant  stage,  can 
accumulate  osmolytes,  produce  exopolysaccharides  (EPS). 
Additionally, PGPR have the ability to synthesize plant hor-
mones  (IAA,  cytokinins,  etc),  that  stimulate  plant  growth 
and  division  under  drought  conditions  [96].  Many  PGPR 
strains  produce  antioxidants  and  cytokinin,  which  result  in 
abscisic  acid  (ABA)  accumulation  and  degradation  of  reac-
tive  oxygen  species.  For  example,  Azospirillum  brasilense 
ameliorates  the  response  of  the  plant  to  drought  mainly  via 
enhancement  of  ABA  levels  to  tolerate  drought  stress  [97]. 

Salinity  causes  low  water  potential  in  soil  and  it  is  difficult 
for  the  plant  to  uptake  water  and  nutrients  from  the  soil, 
which  results  in  osmotic  stress.  PGPB  ameliorate  salt  stress 
by  potentially  accumulating  osmolytes  in  their  cytoplasm, 
which counteract on osmotic stress and maintain cell turgor 
and  plant  growth.  Microbial  EPS  induce  resistance  against 
salinity  by  binding  with  cations,  thus  making  it  unavailable 
to plants under stress conditions [98]. Thus the development 
of superior or novel PGPB strains by improving traits can be 
possible using genetic manipulations in the post-genomic era 
and  can  be  exploited  as  a  low-input,  sustainable  and  envi-
ronment-friendly  technology  for  the  management  of  plant 
stress (Fig. 3). 

6.  APPLICATIONS  OF  BENEFICIAL  MICROBES 
FOR CROP IMPROVEMENT 

- and NH4

  The  green  revolution  that  started  in  the  1970s  greatly 
enhanced the agricultural yield and produce through the use 
of  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides.  However,  over  the 
years, there have been reports about the potential hazards of 
the chemicals on soil, ecology and human health. Only 50% 
of the nitrogenous fertilizers are assimilated by the plant, the 
rest  is  lost  through  evaporation,  drainage  or  leaching.  This 
+ in the groundwa-
leads to a very high level of NO3
ters  that  cause  potential  threats  to  human  health  [99].  This 
predicament has highlighted the potential use of microbes for 
crop improvement and this idea has been gaining momentum 
over  many  decades,  for  the  sole  reason  that  conventional 
organic farming alone will not suffice to produce crops with 
higher  yield  and  greater  resistance  to  disease.  Effective  mi-
crobes (EMs) or the plant growth-promoting microorganisms 
(PGPM)  comprise  PGPB,  PGPR  and  vesicular-arbuscular 
mycorrhizae  (AMF)  fungi  [100].  Studies  have  implicated 
various  microorganisms  with  befitting  mechanisms  for  crop 
improvement  and  we  will  be  citing  a  few  examples  of  the 
same.  Biofertility  inoculants  are  the  inoculation  of  microor-
ganisms applied to the soil that greatly enhance plant growth 
through nutrient acquisition and solubilization. Nitrogen and 
phosphorous  are  the  sparsely  available  nutrients  in  the  soil. 
Microorganisms  with  enhanced  abilities  to  acquire  these 
nutrients  are  being  studied  as  potential  candidates  for  nutri-
ent  acquisition  [101].  PGPR  Bacillus  sp.1  (FOW1)  and 
Lysinibacillus sp. (FOW7) have been reported to be tolerant 
to pesticides while still possessing bioremediation activity of 
enhancing crop yields through proper soil aeration, soil wa-
ter holding property and boosting the plant growth [102]. Six 
strains  of  nitrogen-fixing-  endophytic  bacteria  were  tested 
for  their  ability  to  enhance  the  growth  of  Piceaglauca  x 
trees, and it was proven that they were indeed able to cause a 
significant increase in plant biomass and seedling length and 
possessed enhanced ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen [103]. 
Fungi have been studied to have more phosphate solubilizing 
activity  than  bacteria.  Many  fungi  like  Penicillium  bilaiae 
are  being  commercially  marketed  (brand  name-  Jumpstart); 
this organism solubilizes phosphate by using citric and oxal-
ic  acid  as  phosphate-solubilizing  agents  [104].  Biocontrol 
organisms,  on  the  other  hand,  are  antagonists  to  harmful 
pathogenic organisms and are being extensively studied and 
used  for  field  applications  [101].  Consortia  of  endophytic 
nodule  forming  bacteria-  (Pseudomonas  sp.),  UFLA  02-286 
(Bacillus  sp.),  and  UFLA  04-227  (Burkholderiafungorum)

when applied along with Rhizobium tropici (CIAT 899) were 
able to enhance the growth of common bean and also control 
the  pathogen  Rhizoctonia  solani  [105].  Recent  studies  have 
also  exploited  the  antagonistic  activity  of  the  endophytic 
bacterium  Bacillus  velezensis  OEE1  against  Verticillium 
dahlia,  the  causal  agent  of  verticillium  wilt  of  olive  plants 
[106].  The  metagenomic  approach  of  studying  entire  ge-
nomes of all organisms (both culturable and con-culturable) 
present  in  different  niches  is  spiking  the  interest  of  many 
researchers,  as  it  taps  on  the  humongous  knowledge  of  all 
the  beneficial  microbes  that  can  be  used  for  plant  growth 
promotion and as biocontrol agents [107]. Instead of concen-
trating  solely  on  the  rhizosphere  microbial  consortium,  re-
searchers  have  studied  that  the  microbiomes  of  lichens,  al-
pine  mosses,  and  prime  rose  were  able  to  promote  growth 
and  enhance  stress  tolerance  in  economically  viable  plants 
like  maize  and  sugarbeet  [108].  Functional  analysis  of  the 
different  rhizosphere,  phyllosphere,  and  endosphere  meta-
genomes  has  provided  highly  useful  insights  into  species 
diversity of different microorganisms associated with differ-
ent  plants  and  habitats.  Furthermore,  functions  like  nutrient 
acquisition  (nitrogen  fixation,  phosphorus  utilization,  and 
iron  mobilization),  as  well  as  stress  tolerance,  have  been 
associated  with  these  microbiomes  in  these  studies  [109-
111].  Metagenome  analysis  of  the  phenol  adapted  refinery 
wastewater yielded a novel genome of a novel member from 
Bradyrhizobiaceae  family  with  unique  properties  like  nitro-
gen fixation, nitrate uptake and conversion to nitrite, sulfate 
utilization,  iron  uptake  and  aromatic  compound  (phenol) 
utilization  [112].  In  the  recent  years,  there  have  been  tre-
mendous advancements in non-culturing techniques like ge-
nomics,  proteomics,  metabolomics,  and  molecular  biology; 
which  include  techniques  like-  DNA  cloning,  Sanger  se-
quencing,  denaturing  gradient  gel  electrophoresis  (DGGE), 

terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), 
fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH),  stable  isotope 
probe  (SIP),  the  most  recent  next-generation  sequencing 
(NGS),  etc.  These  techniques  provide  impressive  insights 
into  non-culturable  metagenomes  and  also  help  in  the  func-
tional  characterization  of  these  microorganisms  [113].  The 
use of these metagenomic consortia for field applications has 
now been gaining momentum, however, it has its own road-
blocks  like-pathogenesis  caused  by  unknown  microorgan-
isms  in  the  consortium,  food  contamination  that  could  be 
hazardous  to  human  health,  and  a  more  practicality  based 
problem of the inability of the microorganisms to be cultured 
[113].  Strategies  to  culture  non-culturable  members  of  the 
microbiome are currently being studied and need new media 
and culture techniques to be developed. These strategies will 
help provide greater insights into the beneficial as well as the 
harmful microbes associated with the consortium and help in 
creating  better  formulations  for  use  in  agricultural  fields 
[114]. 

CONCLUSION,  FUTURE  PROSPECTS  AND  CHAL-
LENGES 

  Beneficial microbial-plant interaction can lead to promis-
ing  solutions  for  environmentally  sustainable  farming. 
Moreover,  plant-microbe  interaction  has  played  a  vital  role 
in developing the biofertilizer, biocontrol and bioremediation 
agents in sustainable agriculture. Although there is plenty of 
literature on plant-microbe interaction, the molecular mecha-
nism underlying genes function and signal transduction dur-
ing beneficial and pathogenic interaction are lacking. There-
fore,  understanding  the  genetic  basis  of  plant-microbe  rela-
tionship  with  the  next-generation  sequencing  technology 
along with various ‘omics’ technologies will be the emerging

tool  to  provide  extensive  and  in-depth  knowledge  on  the 
biological phenomenon to improve plant health, disease con-
trol,  improve  food  quality  and  enhance  plant  stress  (both 
biotic  and  abiotic)  management  [115,  116].  The  near  future 
faces many challenges in this area of research that need to be 
addressed for an integrated understanding of plant-pathogen 
interactions.  These  challenges  are  mainly,  identification  of 
key factors involved in such interaction during plant immune 
responses,  detection  and  effective  management  of  new 
emerging and re-emerging plant pathogens and development 
of  pathogen-resistant  crops.  In  the  post-genomic  era,  under-
standing  the  mechanism  of  plant  microbe-interaction  could 
help  mitigate  these  challenges,  thus  enhancing  sustainable 
agriculture.  Genomics  tools  mentioned  in  this  review,  such 
as  GWAS,  will  continue  to  provide  us  novel  disease  re-
sistance  or  defense-related  genes  that  can  be  incorporated 
into  crops  through  biotechnological  approaches,  which  will 
become  increasingly  popular  in  the  next  few  years  and  will 
further  advance  our  understanding  towards  crop  advance-
ment.
