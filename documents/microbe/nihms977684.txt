Abstract

The skin is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that is inhabited by bacteria, archaea, fungi and 
viruses. These microbes—collectively referred to as the skin microbiota—are fundamental to skin 
physiology and immunity. Interactions between skin microbes and the host can fall anywhere 
along the continuum between mutualism and pathogenicity. In this Review, we highlight how 
host–microbe interactions depend heavily on context, including the state of immune activation, 
host genetic predisposition, barrier status, microbe localization, and microbe–microbe interactions. 
We focus on how context shapes the complex dialogue between skin microbes and the host, and 
the consequences of this dialogue for health and disease.

The skin’s outermost aspect consists of a lipid- and protein-laden cornified layer dotted with 
hair follicles and glands that secrete lipids, antimicrobial peptides, enzymes, salts, and many 
other compounds (Fig. 1a). Whereas the skin surface is an acidic, high-salt, dessicated, 
aerobic environment, the invaginations that form folliculo-sebaceous units are comparatively 
anaerobic and even more lipid-rich7,8 (Fig. 1b). The skin surface and follicles are physically 
and chemically distinct from another microbe-rich barrier site: the small and large intestines. 
The intestine is moist, polysaccharide-rich, neutral in pH, and full of diverse carbon and 
nitrogen sources9–11. Additionally, in contrast to the hair follicle, deeper aspects of intestinal 
crypts that are closer to the epithelium become more aerobic while the lumen is more 
anaerobic12,13. The skin, on the other hand, is replete in diverse and unusual lipids not found 
elsewhere in the body14,15 (Fig. 2). Some of these lipids, such as sapienic acid, can have 
antimicrobial activities16, while others, such as triglycerides, can be metabolized by

microbes17 into free fatty acids and di- and monoglycerides that can be bioactive against 
other microbes or stimulatory to host cells18.

Across skin regions, the density and variety of glands and hair follicles vary considerably, 
creating a complex physical and chemical landscape of geographically distinct niches for 
bacterial growth. For example, Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium)19 and 
Staphylococcus species dominate sebaceous areas (such as the face and torso), while 
Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and beta-Proteobacteria are found in moist areas (such as 
the armpits and the elbow and knee creases)20.

In broad terms, the chemistry of a skin niche drives its microbiome composition, but 
unknown microbial and host factors contribute to important species- and strain-level 
differences in composition. For some species, such as Cutibacterium acnes19, the same strain 
tends to colonize multiple body sites of the same individual; others, such as Staphylococcus 
epidermidis, differ among body sites of an individual (but tend to be similar in, for example, 
the axillae of different individuals)21. Most metagenomic cataloguing of the human 
microbiome has focused on species composition. However, recent work demonstrates that, 
even within the same species, different strains can differ markedly in their effects on the 
host22. Strain-level differences have been largely unexplored and remain a frontier for 
studies of the skin microbiota.

The process of skin microbiota assembly begins during birth and proceeds primarily 
according to body site over several weeks23. The microbiota shifts notably during puberty, 
with increased predominance of Corynebacterium and Cutibacterium (formerly 
Propionibacterium) and decreased abundance of Firmicutes (including Staphylococcus and 
Streptococcus species)24. In adulthood, despite the skin’s continuous exposure to the 
environment, the microbial composition remains surprisingly stable over time25. This 
suggests that stabilizing, mutually beneficial interactions exist among commensal microbes 
and between microbes and the host.

The composition of the skin microbiome can shift markedly during inflammation26. It is not 
yet understood how pathogens and skin inflammation contribute to a vicious cycle, how 
homeostasis is re-established, or how pathogens interact with the existing commensal 
population. The critical role of context to the outcome of a microbe–host interaction 
animates this review. For example, pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus often colonize 
the skin asymptomatically, whereas mutualists such as S. epidermidis can at times promote 
disease27,28. In this Review, we highlight recent work demonstrating that host–microbe 
interactions fall along a continuum in which pure pathogenicity and mutualism are at 
extreme ends, and are rarely useful descriptors. We discuss the importance of context—
genetic predisposition, the level of host immune activation, the physical and chemical 
landscape of the niche, and mitigating or activating microbe–microbe interactions—to the 
outcome of a host–microbe interaction, and consider how colonization extends from the 
skin’s surface into the follicles and even into subcutaneous tissues.

Host–mutualist interactions

Most microbes living on the skin behave as commensal or mutualistic under steady-state 
conditions. In contrast to the gut of germ-free mice, which shows grossly altered lymphoid 
organ development, the skin of germ-free mice does not show marked morphological 
defects29,30. Nonetheless, skin-resident microbes play important roles in the maturation and 
homeostasis of cutaneous immunity. The skin microbiota modulate the expression of various 
innate factors, including interleukin 1a (IL-1α)29; components of complement31; and 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are produced by keratinocytes and sebocytes (Fig. 
1a). Skin-derived AMPs constitute a diverse array of protein families, but cathelicidins and 
β-defensins predominate. Although some AMPs are constitutively expressed, others can be 
stimulated by specific members of the microbiota such as Cutibacterium5,32 or produced by 
microbes themselves (including Cutibacterium thiopeptides33 and S. epidermidis 
AMPs34,35). It is not yet known how the combination of microbiota-induced and microbiota-
produced AMPs shape microbial communities, but this multidirectional signalling is likely 
to play an important role in the ecology of skin microbial communities.

One major genus of skin-resident bacteria is Corynebacterium, members of which are 
present at all body sites and dominate in moist sites. Interestingly, corynebacteria share 
many microbiological features with the closely related mycobacteria, but these two genera 
interact very differently with the host. It remains a challenge to understand how the immune 
system distinguishes between bacteria with such similar surface and cellular structures (Fig. 
3), and to determine which factors unique to Corynebacterium might be responsible for its 
commensalism. These questions will help to define the molecular-level differences between 
mutualism and pathogenicity, and explain how commensal bacteria ‘educate’ the cutaneous 
immune system.

Corynebacterium minutissimum (erythrasma) and Corynebacterium tenuis (trichomycosis 
axillaris) have been associated with superficial skin pathology, but most Corynebacterium 
species present in surveys of the skin microbiome do not cause any known disease. 
Corynebacteria and mycobacteria share the unusual feature among Gram-positive bacteria of 
having an outer membrane, analogous to that of Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 3). This outer 
membrane consists of an outer lipid bilayer of long α-branched fatty acids called mycolic 
acids, which envelop (and are covalently linked to) the meshwork of peptidoglycan 
underneath. The Corynebacterium cell wall features additional lipoglycans termed 
lipomannans and lipoarabinomannans, which are anchored to the plasma membrane and 
have long oligosaccharide chains that emanate from the cell surface. Lipomannans and 
lipoarabinomannans are ligands for host glycan receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 
and C-type lectin receptors, driving either pro- or anti-inflammatory responses depending on 
their structure and the immunological context in which they are sensed36–42. In 
mycobacteria, lipomannans and lipoarabinomannans play important roles in immune 
recognition and evasion43. It remains to be determined whether similar structures in 
corynebacteria engage cutaneous immune cells, and whether immune recognition of 
corynebacteria may protect against future mycobacterial infections.

In addition to microbe–host interactions, many reports have suggested that microbe–microbe 
interactions also impact human health. For example, a common skin resident, 
Corynebacterium accolens, was recently shown to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, a common respiratory tract pathogen44. The active principle of this interaction 
is an essential corynebacterial lipase that hydrolyses triolein to release oleic acid, which 
inhibits pneumococcal growth44. Another common skin resident, Corynebacterium striatum, 
shifts the global transcriptional program of co-cultured S. aureus in a way that suppresses 
virulence-related genes and stimulates genes assocated with commensalism28. These data 
suggest that the role of skin-resident microbes goes beyond competitive exclusion; these 
microbes are likely to engage in a web of microbe–microbe interactions that help to tune the 
behaviour of their co-residents in subtle and context-specific ways.

Another dominant group of skin colonists are the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus 
species, the most prominent of which is S. epidermidis. Although S. epidermidis can be an 
opportunisitic pathogen in the context of primary or iatrogenic immunosuppression, it 
functions predominantly as a mutualist. Skin-resident Staphylococcus species engage in 
microbe–microbe interactions that are beneficial to the host. For example, S. epidermidis 
and Staphylococcus hominis have been shown to secrete antimicrobial peptides that kill S. 
aureus, and transplantation of these species onto the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis 
led to decreased colonization by S. aureus35.

Recent studies of S. epidermidis provided the first evidence that skin-resident bacteria are 
not just passive residents; they actively engage host immunity through an intact skin barrier, 
and activate specific immune cell populations in a species- and strain-dependent 
manner29,45. For instance, some strains of S. epidermidis induce activation of S. 
epidermidis-specific IL-17+CD8+ T cells that protect against cutaneous infections by 
inducing keratinocytes to produce AMPs, a phenomenon called heterologous protection45. 
In addition to their protective role, these commensal-specific T cells also promote wound 
repair46. Of interest, S. epidermidis can elicit T cell responses restricted to non-classical 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules46. Thus, non-classical MHC 
class I molecules, an evolutionarily ancient arm of the immune system, may play an 
important role in promoting homeostatic immunity to the microbiota. These data show that 
skin-resident bacteria can have myriad effects on the host; in addition to promoting immune 
barrier responses, commensal–immune interactions can also affect epithelial biology. The 
effects of commensal–immune interactions on many other cutaneous processes, including 
adnexal development, tumorigenesis, ageing, and sensory nerve function, remain to be 
determined. Additionally, whether immune responses against the skin microbiota also 
influence microbiota composition or function remains unexplored. In most settings, the skin 
flora controls skin immunity in an autonomous manner and independently of the gut flora29. 
This compartmentalization and specialization of responses may have evolved as a 
mechanism to constrain the adjuvant properties of commensals and unwanted consequences 
associated with systemic increases in inflammatory responses.

Notably, adaptive responses to members of the skin community develop in the absence of 
inflammation45, in contrast to the response to invading pathogens. This process, termed 
‘homeostatic immunity’, may be induced (at least in part) by the endogenous network of

skin-resident antigen-presenting cells45. Under steady-state conditions, the skin is populated 
by highly diverse T cells47. Thus, because of the extraordinary number of potential antigens 
expressed by the microbiota, a substantial fraction of these skin-resident T cells are expected 
to be microbiota-specific. As a result, primary exposure to a pathogen in the skin or 
exposure during an injury is likely to occur in the context of a much broader recall response 
against diverse microbial antigens. The consequences of this phenomenon for tissue 
responses remain unclear.

Although B cell dynamics in the skin and the role of antibodies in controlling skin microbes 
are not well understood, it is known that IgA is secreted on the skin surface by eccrine and 
sebaceous glands48,49. In the gut, IgA has substantial effects on microbiota composition50–52 
through a process that involves coating commensal bacteria53; in turn, commensal microbes 
are essential to development of this antibody response54,55 and may protect against 
autoimmunity56. Skin commensals are also likely to affect the B cell repertoire, but the 
extent of this interaction and its effects on the microbiota are not yet known.

In light of the finding that S. epidermidis potently and specifically activates a unique branch 
of adaptive immunity, one major challenge is to dissect mechanistically how specific host 
cells and receptors recognize molecular features of S. epidermidis. Staphylococci produce a 
variety of immune modulatory molecules, such as teichoic acids, capsular 
polysaccharides57,58, and dipeptide aldehydes59,60. Just as Corynebacterium and 
Mycobacterium share features but can be distinguished by the host, S. epidermidis shares 
many of these molecular features with the contextual pathogen S. aureus. Further studies of 
how, at the molecular level, S. aureus differs from S. epidermidis will help us understand 
how these two important human skin residents are distinguished by the immune system, and 
will highlight key host targets for more effective and specific therapeutic approaches.

Microbial sensing by the immune system is also likely to be controlled by the developmental 
stage of the host. Although little is understood about the factors that regulate the acquisition 
of skin microbes at birth, regulatory T cells, which are highly enriched in the skin tissue, 
have been proposed to control early dialogue with the microbiota. Indeed, colonization of 
mouse skin with S. epidermidis early in life (but not later) induces tolerance to the same 
microbe in adulthood61 and promotes accumulation of S. epidermidis-specific regulatory T 
cells in neonatal skin62.

As well as modulating immune cells, S. epidermidis and other commensals promote 
epithelial integrity, especially during tissue repair. For example, an S. epidermidis cell wall 
component mitigates inflammation by binding to TLR2, limiting tissue damage and 
promoting wound healing63. Other commensal microbiota are also likely to contribute to 
wound healing, which is a dynamic process associated with global shifts in the skin 
microbiome; wound bed microbiomes that fail to shift are associated with chronic 
ulcers64,65. Within chronic wounds, fungi and bacteria form mixed biofilms and certain 
fungal taxa, such as the phylum Ascomycota, are predictive of wounds that take more than 
eight weeks to heal. The fungal mycobiome and its interactions with commensal bacteria 
may therefore be important contributors to chronic wounds, via mechanisms that have not 
been explored64,65.

The skin microbiota are likely to affect many immune-related and immune-independent 
properties of epithelial health that are not yet appreciated. In the skin, epithelial homeostasis 
is a constant, active, and energy-intensive process that involves the secretion of complex 
lipids for signalling and barrier purposes2,66, maintenance of tight junctions67,68 and 
production of a lipid–protein coat to prevent trans-epidermal water loss69,70, repair of UV-
mediated and oxidative damage to epithelial cells to prevent malignant transformation71,72, 
and constant remediation of accidental trauma (for example, scrapes, cuts, and nicks). Any 
disruption of even a small component of these complex processes can result in extreme 
phenotypes, such as ichthyoses, blistering disorders, progerias, and diffuse fibrosis69,73,74. 
How the skin community contributes to these processes remains to be addressed.

Host–pathogen interactions

Microbe–host interactions that drive (or result from) infectious processes have historically 
received the most investigative attention. A canonical host–pathogen interaction in the skin 
involves a one-to-one mapping of microbe to disease and an easily identified phenotype of 
inflammation. Most of what is known about the skin immune system has been discovered by 
studying interactions of this sort, highlighting the utility of this simplistic paradigm and 
foreshadowing its limitations. As we will discuss, most microbe–host interactions on the 
skin are more nuanced; a threshold example is the observation that traditional pathogens 
often reside on the skin surface in an asymptomatic manner.

In terms of cost and prevalence, one of the most important pathogens of the skin is S. aureus. 
Although more than 30% of healthy individuals are colonized asymptomatically by S. 
aureus75,76, it can cause a wide spectrum of infections: some are limited to a single hair 
follicle (furuncle), others involve subcutaneous tissues (cellulitis), and the most serious 
feature potentially fatal penetration into any organ in the body, including bone 
(osteomyelitis), bloodstream (bacterial sepsis), and heart valves (bacterial endocarditis). S. 
aureus has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases such as atopic 
dermatitis22,77–79, and more recently in systemic lupus erythematosus with renal and skin 
involvement80.

S. aureus is a versatile pathogen with a broad array of virulence factors81,82, including 
neutrophil-killing toxins83, chemotaxis inhibitors84, anti-phagocytic and anti-killing surface 
molecules57,85–88, superantigens, and immune evasion proteins89,90. In patients with atopic 
dermatitis, S. aureus isolates grow as biofilms on the skin and produce proteases that 
degrade host AMPs, such as cathelicidin LL-3791. The host has evolved mechanisms to ward 
off invasion by S. aureus at every level of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. In addition to a 
diverse arsenal of AMPs covering the epidermis, there is also evidence that adipose tissue 
under the dermis contributes to the innate immune response. Following breach of the skin 
barrier and subsequent S. aureus infection, local pre-adipocytes proliferate rapidly, 
expanding the subdermal fat layer and increasing production of the AMP cathelicidin92.

Although some virulence and immune evasion elements are conserved across all species of 
S. aureus, there are important strain-level differences. For example, the arginine catabolic 
mobile element contributes to the ability of USA300, a methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain,

to thrive in the acidic environment of human skin and resist host polyamines, helping to 
explain this strain’s prevalence in skin and soft tissue infections93,94. Recent work has also 
shown that certain strains of S. aureus are not only associated with more severe atopic 
dermatitis, but are also sufficient to induce skin inflammation in mice independent of host 
genetic predisposition22. This work revealed that the most common method of describing 
microbiome composition, with genus- or species-level data, fails to resolve important 
functional differences among strains, which can result from modest gene gain or loss events 
or even differences in gene expression among strains.

Another prominent genus of skin pathogens is Mycobacterium, a Gram-positive rod within 
the phylum Actinobacteria. Mycobacteria are a diverse genus of organisms that includes the 
causative agents of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (Mycobacterium 
leprae), and other species that cause infections at surgical sites or sites of accidental trauma 
(for example, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium chelonae, and Mycobacterium 
marinum). M. tuberculosis, which generally causes pulmonary or systemic infections, is well 
known; however, skin and soft tissue infections caused by other Mycobacterium species are 
increasing in prevalence in developed countries95 and continue to be serious problems in 
developing countries96. We highlight mycobacteria because they generate an especially 
broad spectrum of pathologies, from acute systemic illness to skin manifestations to inert 
granulomas that persist throughout the lifetime of a host. In addition, mycobacteria are 
closely related to skin-resident corynebacteria but have very different effects on the host. 
The similarities and differences between Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium will 
probably yield insights into a broad swath of fundamentally important host–microbiota 
interactions.

M. tuberculosis is one of the most successful pathogens on the planet: it colonizes one-
quarter of the world’s population (1.7 billion people) in the form of a latent infection97, with 
the World Health Organization estimating that 10.4 million new infections occurred in 
201598. Among humans who are latent carriers of M. tuberculosis, only 10% will suffer 
reactivation into active tuberculosis during their lifetime99. A related pathogen, M. leprae, 
also causes a wide range of diseases, including diverse skin manifestations that can involve 
the nerves, liver, and bones100,101. The time period between M. leprae inoculation and 
clinical manifestation of infection is typically 2–12 years and can be up to a few decades; 
during this time, the bacterium handily evades host immunity. It is particularly notable that 
the majority of humans who harbour M. tuberculosis and M. leprae neither display obvious 
pathology nor die from their infection. This suggests that we have much to discover about 
the mechanisms of long-term immune evasion, and that the traditional definition of 
‘colonist’ may need to expand to include an organism such as M. tuberculosis, which on the 
one hand is a pathogen that kills more than a million people each year102, and on the other 
hand lives asymptomatically in billions of people and results in the death of only a small 
percentage of its hosts.

One recently discovered mechanism of mycobacterial host evasion involves the nervous 
system. Mycobacterium ulcerans causes the Buruli ulcer, a progressive, necrotic ulcer that is 
the third most common mycobacterial disease worldwide103. The Buruli ulcer is painless, 
which contributes to delays in treatment and therefore increases the requirement for more

drastic interventions at later infectious stages, when the only available treatment is surgical 
resection. M. ulcerans produces a polyketide toxin, mycolactone, that is essential for 
virulence. Recent work has shown that mycolactone induces analgesia via the angiotensin II 
receptor, COX-1, and prostaglandin E2, ultimately resulting in activation of TRAAK 
potassium channels and cell hyperpolarization104. Not only does this work provide possible 
avenues to therapeutic biomimetics for pain relief and to the development of therapies 
against M. ulcerans, but it also demonstrates a novel mode of pathogen–host interaction in 
which the peripheral nervous system is targeted directly.

Involvement of the peripheral nervous system may be more general and integral to skin 
immunity than has been previously recognized. Candida albicans, a fungal pathogen, also 
triggers sensory neurons directly; these neurons then stimulate host immunity and activate 
protective IL-17-producing dermal T cells105. S. aureus also activates cutaneous neurons 
directly via N-formylated peptides and the pore-forming toxin α-haemolysin, inducing pain 
and neuropeptide-mediated induction of vasodilation and inflammation106. More recently, a 
direct mechanistic link between neurons and immune cells has been discovered. For 
instance, in the gut, mucosal neurons were found to produce a neuropeptide, neuromedin U 
(NMU), that binds an NMU receptor on group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and triggers 
a protective immune response107. Direct microbiota–nervous system interactions appear to 
be a broader phenomenon than was previously appreciated, with examples emerging in other 
body sites; in a recent case, a microbiota-derived metabolite (isovaleric acid) was shown to 
trigger a receptor enriched in enterchromaffin cells, resulting in the basolateral release of 
serotonin, which stimulated sub-epithelial enteric nervous system afferents108.

As well as evading immunity so that an infection can establish, mycobacteria can also persist 
for decades inside granulomas, which are organized aggregates of macrophages. Bacteria 
living within a granuloma, in equilibrium with the host, can be considered a form of tissue 
colonization. In the gut, for example, certain subsets of commensal bacteria intracellularly 
colonize CD11c+ dendritic cells in healthy mice and promote innate lymphoid cell responses 
that prevent systemic dissemination of these bacteria, as well as IL-10 production that 
protects against intestinal inflammation and damage109,110. These data demonstrate that 
commensal colonists can reside not only on the surface of the host, but also within host cells 
and tissues, and that these bacteria can elicit a balance of immune-reactive and 
immunosuppressive responses in the host. For mycobacteria, granulomas may seed the 
infection of new macrophages, leading to dissemination111. However, in 80–90% of healthy 
patients with latent tuberculosis, reactivation does not occur during the lifetime of the 
host112. In these patients, M. tuberculosis persists within macrophages, using a variety of 
strategies including efflux pumps that promote drug tolerance113–115, increased cell wall 
biosynthesis116, and global transcriptional changes to survive in anaerobic conditions117–119. 
Within a single host, granulomas can resolve variably: some become sterile, others harbour 
latent bacteria, and some allow bacteria to escape120 in a manner that does not depend on 
host or bacterial genetic features. Therefore, even for an individual pathogen within a single 
host, it is not yet understood how the specifics of context affect the outcome of a microbe–
host encounter.

As well as bacterial pathogens, there are numerous viral and fungal pathogens of the skin. 
Some viruses, such as human papillomaviruses and herpesviruses, can cause acute pathology 
but generally persist in a latent manner for a lifetime. Other viruses, such as the 
orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus, are cleared after epicutaneous infection. Although our current 
understanding of these viruses encompasses only their pathogenic behaviour, analyses of the 
double-stranded DNA virome have shown that papillomaviruses and poxviruses can also 
colonize hosts asymptomatically21,121. Even in the ‘simple’ case of vaccinia virus, intravital 
multiphoton microscopy has shown a complex spatial orchestration of immune events; 
although viral infection occurs in keratinocytes, responding CD8+ T cells do not target the 
infected keratinocytes but rather innate immune cells122. Counterintuitively, high local 
production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 helps to limit vaccinia replication and 
dissemination123.

An immune cell population that has received attention for its ability to promote memory 
responses to viruses (and, potentially, other members of the microbiota) is resident memory 
T (TRM) cells—a population of lymphocytes that occupies tissues without recirculating124. 
While most studies have focused on virally induced CD8+ TRM cells, CD4+ TRM cells (or at 
least cells with a resident phenotype) have also been shown to accumulate in the skin in 
response to a large array of infections. Notable differences in anatomical localization exist 
for memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with CD4+ T cells maintained primarily within the 
dermis and CD8+ T cells within the epidermal compartment125. Given that herpesviruses, 
papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses that infect epithelial cells generate a high burden of 
chronic skin disease and, in some cases, aggressive skin cancers, there is an urgent need to 
better understand how these infections are contained by or escape cutaneous immunity.

Contextual pathogenicity

Traditionally, the term ‘pathobiont’ has been applied to organisms that have the potential to 
cause disease but often colonize a host without inducing pathology. Two prominent gut 
pathobionts are segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), which stimulates T helper 17 
(TH17) cells in the mouse gut to confer protection against pathogens but can also induce 
severe colitis; and Helicobacter pylori, which colonizes half of the human population, but in 
a small percentage can cause peptic ulcer disease and potentiate gastric 
adenocarcinoma126–129. However, in more extreme contexts of host predisposition, many 
other microbial species have the potential to cause diease. Patients with primary 
immunodeficiency (PID), for example, develop chronic, severe skin infections, many of 
them induced by normal constituents of the microbiota or environmental microbes130.

Transitioning from commensalism (for example, on the skin surface or in a follicle) to 
pathogenicity (for example, in the bloodstream) is a complex and potentially costly process 
for the microbe. The skin is an imposing physical barrier, and even if it is breached, the 
microbe must fend off numerous layers of innate responses, including AMPs, proteases, and 
reactive oxygen species. In addition, would-be pathogens need to induce the expression of 
genes that enable adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion (that is, virulence factors). As a 
result, most commensal microbes coexist peacefully with their host, and will exhibit 
pathogenic potential only in specific settings. Conversely, microbes that are traditionally

considered pathogens do not indiscriminately display aggressive behaviour. As discussed 
above, the term pathogen does not encompass the range of phenotypes displayed by S. 
aureus or M. tuberculosis. Viewed in this light, the term pathobiont becomes unhelpfully 
broad. Therefore, we suggest that the concept of a continuum of contextual pathogenicity 
and mutualism may be more useful (Fig. 4). In this section, we discuss examples of 
microbes that might traditionally be referred to as pathobionts: those that represent the 
middle of the spectrum between aggressive and mutualistic behaviour.

One example is C. acnes, which has been implicated in acne131–133 and hidradenitis 
suppurativa134. However, the contribution of C. acnes to the pathogenesis of acne is 
unclear131. On the one hand, C. acnes produces coproporphyrin III, which has been shown 
to induce the formation of S. aureus biofilms135—generally seen as a negative consequence 
for the host. On the other hand, C. acnes has also been shown to ferment glycerol into short-
chain fatty acids, which suppress the growth of virulent methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
USA300136. These data suggest that rich networks of microbe–microbe interactions may 
govern host inflammation and disease in a strain- and context-dependent manner.

A similar range of harmful and beneficial effects have been demonstrated for other 
microbes. Herpesviruses are frequent pathogens of the skin, with notable examples including 
chickenpox (varicella zoster virus) and recurrent labial ulcers (HSV1 and HSV2); however, 
after the acute infection has resolved, herpesviruses persist within the host as dormant, latent 
viruses for the host’s lifetime. In mice, this herpesvirus latency has been shown to stimulate 
the immune system in a way that is protective against bacterial pathogens for months137,138. 
As noted above, H. pylori colonizes the stomach and can cause ulcers and promote gastric 
cancer. However, it has long evolved to live within human hosts, and is also thought to 
protect against tuberculosis139 and allergic diseases such as childhood asthma140.

Although S. epidermidis is generally beneficial to the host, it is also a leading cause of death 
in premature infants and nosocomial infections27,141. Conversely, Mycobacterium species 
such as M. leprae and M. tuberculosis are known for their ability to cause serious systemic 
illness but can persist subclinically inside a granuloma for the lifetime of a host. To 
generalize, all microbes that reside on or inside a host fall along a spectrum, with some 
displaying almost no aggressive behaviour and others displaying primarily virulent, invasive 
phenotypes. The majority of skin residents probably lie somewhere in the middle of the 
spectrum, and an important challenge in future work will be to better understand which host 
and environmental factors govern a microbe’s switch between passive and aggressive 
behaviours.

Discussion

The examples discussed herein illustrate that a scheme in which skin-resident microbes are 
classified as ‘full-time’ pathogens, mutualists or pathobionts may need to be updated to 
include the effects of context (Fig. 4). Future work will need to investigate the context-
dependent behaviour of resident microbes—how microbe–microbe interactions, host–
microbe interactions, and strain-specific differences may govern a microbe’s tendency 
towards cooperation or aggression.

As we learn more about how commensal bacterial strains activate specific immune cell 
populations, we may be able to harness this specificity by engineering microbes to deliver 
cytokines, small molecules, or vaccines to specific, activated immune cell populations across 
an intact skin barrier. A clearer understanding of the dense network of microbe–microbe 
interactions will also allow us to provide more targeted therapies for dysbiosis, which has 
been implicated in atopic dermatitis but is also being explored as a pathogenic contributor to 
many other skin diseases, including psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and lupus 
erythematosus. In the gut, using microbes to correct dysbiosis has been successful in the 
case of faecal transplants for Clostridium difficile infections142, and more recently in the use 
of a Lactobacillus plantarum synbiotic to prevent neonatal sepsis143. Similar live microbial 
therapies for the skin have not yet been developed. However, harnessing the 
immunomodulatory45 or antimicrobial properties of skin commensal bacteria144 has great 
potential. Furthermore, because of the unique chemical milieu of the skin (Fig. 2), local 
alterations in defined nutrients may have a marked impact on the composition or function of 
skin microbiota and—when rationally designed—could promote the expansion of microbes 
endowed with regulatory or protective properties.

Another important category of microbe–host interactions that has not been well explored 
consists of distant effects between microbes at one site, for example in the gut, and host 
responses at another site, such as the skin. Recently, immune checkpoint blockade has 
achieved unprecedented success in the treatment of multiple skin cancers that were 
previously associated with high rates of mortality, including metastatic melanoma, squamous 
cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma145–148. Although these are cutaneous cancers, 
commensal gut bacteria have been implicated in the efficacy of anti-tumour 
immunotherapies at distant sites149,150. Conversely, how skin-resident microbes influence 
immune responses systemically or at distant sites is an important area for further research. 
Processes that were previously thought to involve skin-limited inflammation, such as plaque 
psoriasis, have now been linked to an increase in systemic inflammatory co-morbidities, 
such as atheroscle-rotic cardiovascular disease151–154. Indeed, many types of immune cell 
are known to traffic in and out of skin during both homeostasis and inflammation155–157. 
These observations suggest that the effects of the skin microbiota on the immune system 
may have wide-ranging systemic sequelae that are ripe for exploration in the near future.

These findings add another layer of complexity to microbe–host interactions, suggesting that 
research should not only focus on interactions within the local microenvironment but also 
encompass trafficking of microbiota-educated immune cell populations, or microbial 
products and metabolites, to other body sites upon stimulation by microbes at diverse barrier 
sites.

Figure 1. Crosstalk between skin microbiota and the host
a, Diverse microbes (viruses, fungi and bacteria) cover the skin surface and associated 
structures (hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands), possibly forming biofilms at 
some sites. These microbes metabolize host proteins and lipids and produce bioactive 
molecules, such as free fatty acids, AMPs, phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), cell wall 
components, and antibiotics158,159. These products act on other microbes to inhibit pathogen 
invasion, on the host epithelium to stimulate keratinocyte-derived immune mediators such as 
complement and IL-1, and on immune cells in the epidermis and dermis. In turn, host 
products and immune cell activity influence microbial composition on the skin. b, The skin 
differs from the gut in its physical and chemical properties. The skin is a dry, acidic, lipid-
rich, high-salt environment without exogenous nutrient sources, and therefore has low 
microbial biomass. By contrast, the gut is moist and has abundant nutrients and a thick layer 
of mucin9,159, enabling it to support much greater microbial biomass. While hair follicles 
become more anaerobic deeper into the follicle, crypts become more aerobic closer to the 
epithelium7,11. In addition, material within crypts regularly exchanges with material in the 
gut lumen, owing to peristalsis, whereas hair follicles have narrow openings filled with 
sebum and keratinocytic debris, making them more isolated.

Figure 2. Chemistry of the skin
The skin surface consists of a highly organized basketweave structure of keratinocytic 
proteins and lipids, which are produced by keratinocytes (epidermal lipids) and sebaceous 
glands (sebaceous lipids)160. Ceramides are unique to epidermal origin, whereas squalene 
and wax esters are unique to sebaceous origin, with variable composition under endocrine 
control14. Other dominant skin lipids are cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids 
(which are often microbial products). Some lipids, such as sphingosine and free fatty acids, 
demonstrate antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses66 and may have 
immunomodulatory effects144. Of keratinocytic proteins, more than 70% of the dry protein 
weight consists of loricrin, a glycine-rich protein that is thought to have important barrier 
properties160.

Figure 3. Chemistry of microbial surfaces
Bacteria and fungi have diverse cell envelopes loaded with immunogenic molecules. Gram-
negative bacteria (left) have two lipid bilayers separated by a peptidoglycan cell wall. The 
outer leaflet of the outer membrane is studded with an immunogenic lipoglycan called 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has a lipid anchor and highly variable polysaccharide 
region called the O-antigen. In Escherichia coli, for example, 184 different O-antigen 
structures are known161. Gram-positive bacteria (middle) lack an outer lipid bilayer but have 
a thicker peptidoglycan cell wall. Staphylococcus species have wall-bound and membrane-
anchored teichoic acids, which are analogous to Gram-negative LPS, with a host-facing 
strain-specific branched polysaccharide. Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium species also 
have complex lipoglycans, called lipoarabinomannans. They also have a unique lipid outer 
layer made up of cell-wall-bound mycolic acids and other noncovalently bound glycolipids. 
Like Gram-positive bacteria, fungi (right) have only one lipid bilayer membrane. This is 
covered by a cell wall usually consisting of chitin and a β-D-glucan mesh. The outer layer of 
the fungal cell wall often contains heavily mannosylated proteins and sometimes a capsule 
of various polysaccharides. GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine.

Figure 4. Contextual pathogenicity
a, Microbes exhibit contextual pathogenicity along a spectrum. Host factors such as barrier 
breaches and immunosuppression bias microbes towards pathogenic behaviour, whereas 
homeostatic conditions bias them towards mutualistic behaviour. On the microbial side, 
virulence gene expression and microbe–microbe interactions can also push microbial 
behaviour to be mutualistic or pathogenic. In a mutualistic host–microbe relationship, the 
host provides nutrients, while the microbe promotes epithelial and immune homeostasis as 
well as pathogen resistance through microbial products and occupation of metabolic niches. 
In a pathogenic relationship, the microbe invades past the epithelium, causing inflammation, 
and sometimes also benefiting from a host inflammatory response. b, Both S. epidermidis 
and S. aureus are examples of contextual pathogenicity; S. epidermidis is biased towards 
mutualistic behaviour whereas S. aureus displays more pathogenic character.
