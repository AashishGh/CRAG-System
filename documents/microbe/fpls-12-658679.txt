Mechanisms governing plant–microbe interaction in the rhizosphere attracted a lot of
investigative attention in the last decade. The rhizosphere is not simply a source of
nutrients and support for the plants; it is rather an ecosystem teeming with diverse
ﬂora and fauna including different groups of microbes that are useful as well as harmful
for the plants. Plant–microbe interaction occurs via a highly complex communication
network that involves sophisticated machinery for the recognition of friend and foe
at both sides. On the other hand, nitric oxide (NO)
is a key, signaling molecule
involved in plant development and defense. Studies on legume–rhizobia symbiosis
suggest the involvement of NO during recognition, root hair curling, development
of infection threads, nodule development, and nodule senescence. A similar role of
NO is also suggested in the case of plant interaction with the mycorrhizal
fungi.
Another, insight into the plant–microbe interaction in the rhizosphere comes from the
recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)/microbe-associated
molecular patterns (MAMPs) by the host plant and thereby NO-mediated activation
of the defense signaling cascade. Thus, NO plays a major role in mediating the
communication between plants and microbes in the rhizosphere. Interestingly, reports
suggesting the role of silicon in increasing the number of nodules, enhancing nitrogen
ﬁxation, and also the combined effect of silicon and NO may indicate a possibility of their
interaction in mediating microbial communication underground. However, the exact role
of NO in mediating plant–microbe interaction remains elusive. Therefore, understanding
the role of NO in underground plant physiology is very important, especially in relation
to the plant’s interaction with the rhizospheric microbiome. This will help devise new
strategies for protection against phytopathogens and enhancing plant productivity by
promoting symbiotic interaction. This review focuses on the role of NO in plant–microbe
communication underground.

NO in Rhizospheric Plant-Microbe Interactions

INTRODUCTION

others is speciﬁcally scarce. In this review, we discuss the role of
NO in plant–microbe interaction in the rhizosphere.

Plants develop a close association with the microorganisms
inhabiting the areas in and around the roots which are inﬂuenced
by the chemicals (and/or enzymes) released from the plant
roots. The collective term for microbial communities in the
rhizosphere is the root microbiome. The rhizosphere harbors the
largest reservoir of microbial diversity on earth. Several beneﬁcial
microbes are not only able to suppress diseases in host plants
by inhibiting the growth of soil-borne phytopathogens, but they
also stimulate growth and defense responses in host plants by
the production of growth regulators, phytohormones, and other
substances like antibiotics, antifungal metabolites, and defense
enzymes for pathogen control and trigger induced systemic
resistance (ISR) via methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate in
plants, displaying a sophisticated signaling network through
which they communicate. Signaling generally involves signal
perception through the cell wall or cell membrane receptors,
ion channels and sensors, signal transduction through secondary
messengers including cyclic nucleotides, lipid messengers, ions,
free radicals, and gases like nitric oxide (NO). These secondary
messengers then activate target-responsive genes and stimulate
metabolic and physiological responses (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki
and Shinozaki, 2006; Pérez-Clemente et al., 2013). Particularly,
in the rhizosphere,
there exists a multitude of microbial
processes where NO is involved. In plants, two isoforms of
the nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme catalyze the production
of NO from nitrate,
though multiple other pathways for
NO production also exist. However, being highly reactive
NO may prove toxic to the plants. It, therefore, needs to
be converted to a non-toxic and ubiquitous form. This is
accomplished by the covalent attachment of NO group (–NO)
to exposed cysteine thiols to form S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), a
process termed S-nitrosation which is a highly ubiquitous post-
translational modiﬁcation of proteins with diverse regulatory
roles across the diﬀerent kingdoms of life. These SNOs serve
as mobile reservoirs, providing a sustained supply of NO
in vivo, playing key roles in plant physiology under basal
as well as stress conditions. At the cellular level, NO reacts
with glutathione (GSH) to form S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)
a major cellular reservoir of NO, capable of transferring NO
bioactivity to other proteins. The Cellular GSNO levels are
controlled by an evolutionarily conserved cytosolic enzyme
GSNO reductase 1 (GSNOR1).

At the cellular level, biotic and abiotic stress responses are
characterized by immediate redox bursts potentiated by reactive
oxygen and reactive nitrogen species. Decades of research reveal
an intricate balance between various ROS and RNS to maintain a
physiological equilibrium under stress. The magnitude, intensity,
and other characteristics of RNS-mediated redox bursts vary
depending upon the type, magnitude, and intensity of the stress.
The role of NO in plant–pathogen interaction has been studied.
However, a lot is still unknown, about the diﬀerent roles NO plays
during plant–microbe interactions. Information about the role
of NO during the plant’s interaction with useful microorganisms
in the rhizosphere such as the rhizobacteria, mycorrhizae, free-
living plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and fungi, and

2001; Kwon et al., 2012; Baudouin and Hancock, 2014). Also,
reports of its role are suggested in rapid physiological responses
like stomatal closure (Desikan et al., 2004) and the cytokinin
its role in
signaling pathway (Tun et al., 2001). However,
inﬂuencing root growth and developmental processes via auxin-
regulated signaling cascade is considered as one of the most
important functions in plant biology. The role of NO in root
development has been thoroughly reviewed by Molina-Favero
et al. (2007). NO inﬂuences auxin signaling through S-nitrosation
of the auxin receptor TIR1 at cys140 (Terrile et al., 2012). The
view that NO is involved in root development also seems to
have some connections with the root microbiome. Therefore, we
aimed to review the studies that could suggest links between NO
role in root development and its links with the root microbiome.
Several studies suggest the involvement of auxin-induced
NO-dependent pathway during adventitious root
formation
(Pagnussat et al., 2004; Lanteri et al., 2006). Pagnussat et al.
(2002) reported the ﬁrst study suggesting that auxin induces
adventitious root formation through an increase of the NO
concentration at the base of cucumber hypocotyls. Soon after
this study, the same group demonstrated that auxin and NO
trigger both cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent pathways
leading to adventitious root formation. Moreover, the role of
NO in promoting root elongation has also been reported in
maize plants (Gouvea et al., 1997). Other studies also support the
involvement of NO in phosphorous deﬁciency-induced lateral
root development and growth in Lupinus albus (Wang et al.,
2010; Meng et al., 2012), NO-induced NADPH oxidase in
adventitious root growth in Panax ginseng (Tewari et al., 2008;
Tewari and Paek, 2014), Azospirillum brasilense-induced NO
in lateral root formation in tomato (Creus et al., 2005), and
NO-induced modulation in adventitious root growth in Vigna
radiata (Sharma et al., 2019) and rice (Kushwaha et al., 2019).
Furthermore, a recent study also suggests that NO is involved
in the brassinolide-induced adventitious root development in
cucumber (Li et al., 2020). Root hair initiation and elongation in
lettuce also involves NO (Lombardo et al., 2006) and is critical in
determining root hair diﬀerentiation and elongation, mediating
an auxin-triggered signaling cascade. Similar regulation by NO
and auxin has also been reported in Arabidopsis (Lombardo et al.,
2006). Interestingly, bacterial quorum-sensing molecules are also
reported to have a role in plant defense responses and root
development. For instance, molecules like N-3-oxo-decanoyl-
L-homoserine-lactone can induce adventitious root formation
through the activation of cGMP signaling in a hydrogen peroxide
and NO-dependent manner in mung bean (Bai et al., 2012).
Another study has also found enhanced plant growth and

of anerobic respiration which is regulated by OxyR, a regulon
that controls endogenous S-nitrosylation in E. coli (Seth et al.,
2012). Studies have also suggested the involvement of OxyR in
inﬂuencing virulence of plant pathogens (Flores-Cruz and Allen,
2011; Ishiga and Ichinose, 2016).

NO IN PLANTS AND BACTERIA

In plants, NO is produced through enzymatic and non-enzymatic
reactions. One of the enzymatic reactions involves L-arginine
as a primary substrate for NO synthase (NOS) leading to the
production of NO through oxidative pathway (Gupta et al.,
2011). The ﬁrst report of putative NOS activity in plants was
from the roots and nodules of L. albus via indirect detection
of NOS antagonist N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, inhibiting the
production of L-citrulline (Cueto et al., 1996). A unique AtNOS1
gene was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and its mutant
(Atnos1) showed lesser NO content as compared to the wild
type (Guo et al., 2003). Later on, it was renamed NO-associated
protein 1 (AtNOA1) due to its inability to bind and oxidize
arginine (Moreau et al., 2008). In 2010, a study described
the presence of NOS enzyme in Ostreococcus tauri, a single-
celled alga with mostly those characteristics that are present in
animal NOS, thus suggesting the presence of NOS in plants
(Foresi et al., 2010). However, until now the production of NO
via a canonical NOS enzyme remains controversial (Hancock,
2020). NO production through enzymatic reaction also occurs
through NR which catalyzes the conversion of nitrate and
nitrite to NO (Tejada-Jimenez et al., 2019). This process is well
established for NO production in several plant species including
maize, cucumber, spinach, and sunﬂower (reviewed in detail by
Cohen et al., 2009).

In the case of bacteria, the reduction of nitrite to NO is
catalyzed by nitrite reductase which acts as a key enzyme
in the dissimilative denitriﬁcation chain. Dissimilative nitrite
reductase is therefore considered the major known source of
NO in bacteria. Two distinct classes of dissimilatory nitrite
reductases may contain either copper or heme as a cofactor,
out of which heme-containing enzyme is more frequent. The
this redundancy is only speculated
biological relevance of
to be associated with the availability of copper and iron
in diﬀerent microenvironments because enzymes containing
copper and heme never coexist within the same bacterial species
(Cutruzzolà, 1999). Moreover, bacterial NOS (bNOS) activity
was ﬁrst reported in the genus Nocardia (Chen and Rosazza,
1994). Later,
it was reported in many plant-associated and
free-living bacteria including Sinorhizobium, Mycobacterium,
Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Geobacillus, and
(2009). Since bacteria and
Paenibacillus by Cohen et al.
plants share several similar features of NO-producing pathways,
NO is suggested to act as a signaling molecule in plant–
microbe interaction.

Common NO-mediated signaling links in plants and microbes
have also been reported in a few studies. An important role of
NO in plants is its inﬂuence on cellular processes through protein
S-nitrosylation. Interestingly, endogenous S-nitrosylation is also
reported to occur in Escherichia coli as a prominent feature

PLANT–MICROBE INTERACTION: NO
AND THE PLANT INNATE IMMUNE
SYSTEM

Several plant associate microbes are pathogens that impair
growth and reproduction. As such, there would hardly be
any defense without the pathogen. Hence, the co-evolution
of plant–microbe interaction shapes the defense system of
both plants and microbes over time. Jones and Dangl (2006)
proposed that plants possess a two-branched innate immune
system that responds to infection. The ﬁrst branch which
is recognized by a set of receptors, also known as pattern-
recognition receptors (PRRs), recognizes conserved microbe-
associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Typical examples
of
these receptors are LRR receptor-like kinases including
Arabidopsis FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) which recognize a
peptide sequence (22 amino acids) present in bacterial ﬂagellin
and EF-Tu receptor (EFR), recognizing active epitope of bacterial
elongation factor. Therefore, these receptors and the microbial
molecules recognized by them constitute an essential part of
defense related to innate immunity. On the other hand, the
second branch comprises large families of intracellular immune
receptors that encode NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site leucine-
rich repeat) proteins. Meyers et al. (2003) reported the presence of
140 NBS-LLR encoding proteins from the Arabidopsis genome,
whereas the japonica rice genome encodes 500 NBS-LRR proteins
(Zhou et al., 2004). However, PRRs activate their speciﬁc immune
response through pathogen-triggered immunity (PTI), and the
NBS-LRRs activate it through eﬀector-triggered immunity. The
activation of downstream innate immune response through
both these branches initiates with changes in the cytoplasmic
Ca2+ levels, production of reactive oxygen species, and post
translational activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) cascade (Jonak et al., 2002). Furthermore, NO is
produced when plants are treated with MAMPs or during
fungal infection which indicates an important role of NO in
activating the innate defense response (Clarke et al., 2000).

interaction between nominally compatible
plants and bacteria (Conrath et al., 2004; Mur et al., 2005), and
also when plants are treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), NO
mediates the activation of innate defense genes (Zeidler et al.,
2004). Moreover, NO also mediates the regulation of NADPH-
generating enzymes through post-translational modiﬁcations
particularly, tyrosine nitration and S-nitrosation. NADPH is a
versatile coenzyme involved in cellular growth, proliferation,
detoxiﬁcation processes, and maintenance of cellular redox status
(Corpas and Barroso, 2014).

The important pathways which confer plant immune response
are either salicylic acid or jasmonic acid/ethylene pathways.

immunity
While salicylic acid plays a key role in plant
against biotrophic pathogens, it has antagonistic function against
the jasmonic acid pathway which is essential role player in
providing immunity against necrotrophic pathogens and also
during physical wounding (Glazebrook, 2005). Along each
signaling pathway, NO can either induce or suppress signaling.
It initiates salicylic acid biosynthesis and enables nitrosylation
of key cysteines on TGA-class transcription factors to initiate
salicylic acid-dependent gene expression. During pathogenic
attack, salicylic acid concentration increases in response to the
changes in the cellular redox state. This leads to the reduction
of disulﬁde bonds of NPR1 oligomer releasing monomers which
translocate to the nucleus activating pathogenesis-related (PR)
genes. However, oligomerization of NPR1 occurs under higher
levels of SNO via S-nitrosylation. This was shown in Arabidopsis
mutant atgsnor1-3 where NPR1 oligomer accumulates due to
increased GSNO levels which enabled S-nitrosylation at cysteine
(Cys)-156, while reducing monomerization by salicylic acid
thus resulting in delayed activation of PR genes and enhanced
pathogen susceptibility (Tada et al., 2008). Furthermore, Mur
et al. (2013) have reviewed the salicylic acid and jasmonic
acid/ethylene pathways mediated by NO during plant defense

SIGNALING IN PLANT–MICROBE
INTERACTION

Some mechanism of recognition or exchange of molecular signals
between plants and microbes must be present which determines
the speciﬁcity of host–microbe interactions. Certainly, for plant–
microbe interaction to occur, there must be exchange of some
signaling molecules, which is necessary for interaction among
them. The initiation of plant–microbe interaction generally
involves signal exchange through speciﬁc molecules produced
by host or microbe or both during recognition which leads
to the biochemical, physiological, and molecular responses
that aﬀects development of their interaction. Signals initiating,
maintaining, and controlling the interaction determine the
process of successful interactions. Only the compatible microbes
can alter the host defense response out of the millions of
microbes present in the rhizosphere and their communication
aﬀects plant health and growth. Therefore, the focus of recent
research is to determine the signals and regulatory networks
which counteract immune detection and recognize beneﬁcial/
compatible rhizospheric microbes. Here, we are focusing on
the plant growth-promoting microbes and the various suggested
mechanisms through which they interact with the plants. Plant
growth-promoting microbes are the beneﬁcial soil microbes
(bacteria or fungi) colonizing the plant roots and useful in
promoting plant growth and health (Spaepen et al., 2009). They
are well known for their role and application in agriculture
(Reddy et al., 2014).

The plant–microbe interaction occurs in a highly sophisticated
manner, and several specialized metabolites and exudates control

the process. As a result, gene expression is altered in either plant
or microbe or both the interacting partners leading to either
“plant growth, inhibition of soil pathogens, nutrient availability,
bioﬁlm development, or accumulation of soil microbes” (Li
et al., 2013; Mommer et al., 2016; Sasse et al., 2018). The
communication may be inter-/intra-species (microbial quorum
sensing (QS) or signaling volatile organic compounds) or inter-
kingdom communication (root exudates, exchange of symbiotic
signals, bacterial QS signals, and exchange of antimicrobial
and volatile organic compounds) (Bukhat et al., 2020). Out of
the two, our main focus for this review is the inter-kingdom
signaling in the rhizosphere which is widespread, common,
and diverse. Microbial association with plants, particularly,
symbiotic ones is established through the secretion and emission
of beneﬁcial molecules which includes growth regulators like
auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, salicylic acid,
and jasmonic acid and volatile-organic compounds like 2-
heptanol, 2-endecanone, and pentadecane (Fahad et al., 2015).
These molecules activate the plant transcriptome for speciﬁc
changes or adjustments.

Some chemical signals are also transmitted from the plant’s
side which are sensed by speciﬁc microbes for association.
root exudates are reported to attract Bacillus
Cucumber
amyloliquefaciens SQR9, while fumaric acid from banana root
attracts Bacillus subtilis N11; as a result, bioﬁlm formation is
reported in both the cases (Zhang et al., 2014). Other root
exudates involved in plant–microbe interaction are ﬂavonoids
(derivatives of 2-phenyl-1,4-benzopyrone) which trigger nod
genes in bacteria to produce lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs)
for initiating nodule formation in the roots of leguminous
plants. These LCOs are also reported to participate in
fungi and
the interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal
plants, mimicking bacterial QS molecules, and playing role in
inﬂuencing bacterial metabolism (Hassan and Mathesius, 2012).
Moreover, plant exudates like aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
acid (ACC) (Haichar et al., 2012) and tryptophan (Haichar
et al., 2014) are also used by rhizobacteria as precursors of
growth regulators ethylene and auxin, respectively. A recent
study by Ding et al. (2020) suggests that there is alteration in
the transcriptome of the plant pathogen, Fusarium graminearum
which triggers NO production during sensing the presence
of host before establishing physical contact with host’s roots.
Further, virulence in F. graminearum and NO production
during host sensing requires FgANK1, a protein containing
an ankyrin-repeat domain. FgANK1, which normally resides
in the cytoplasm, is translocated to the nucleus in response
to the host signal where it
interacts with a zinc ﬁnger
transcription factor (FgZC1) which is also required for the
speciﬁc binding to the NR promoter, NO production, and
virulence in F. graminearum. Hence, NO is produced in
F. graminearum after host is recognized and FgANK1 and FgZC1
regulate it, but still the exact pathway of NO biosynthesis and
production in F. graminearum or other fungi is still unknown
(Ding et al., 2020). Furthermore, one of the studies from our
group has also reported the growth promotory eﬀects of Bacillus
aryabhattai strain SRB02 in soybean which is modulated by
the production of phytohormones (Park et al., 2017). Although

of the involvement of NO during plant–microbe interaction,

ROLE OF NO AS SIGNAL MOLECULE IN
PLANT–MICROBE INTERACTION

Rhizosphere is home to numerous microbes that may or
may not aﬀect plant growth, health and productivity directly.
However, microbes that do not aﬀect plants directly have
several
their
indirect roles to play. The uncertainty about
roles comes from the limited knowledge of the impact that
these plant-associated microbes may have on the plants.
In-depth studies on rhizospheric symbiotic rhizobia and
mycorrhizal fungi has enabled a greater understanding of their
association with plants. Moreover, as the review focuses on
the role of nitric oxide as an important signaling molecule
in mediating the mutual association, our focus is mainly on
plant-rhizobium signaling because it is the best understood
association where nitric oxide is involved at several steps.
Further, this review may draw attention of the researchers
involved in studying particular plant-microbe interactions,
towards studying the speculated yet unknown role of nitric
oxide signaling network involved in mediating the plant-
microbe interaction.

Recent research studies have demonstrated some important
interactions (Table 1)
roles of NO during plant–bacterial
(Vaishnav et al., 2018). It has been known that the association
of hemoglobins (Hbs) and NO is an important factor between
symbiotic interactions. In addition, NO contents in plant
and symbiont cells are intimately regulated by Hbs and
S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase to minimize toxic eﬀects.
For pathogen interactions,
the expression level of Hb is
maintained at low level to perpetuate NO production and
promote defense response. In the event of symbiotic interactions,
the expression of Hb is rapidly induced and it causes decrease
of NO contents and suppression of plant defense system
(Hichri et al., 2016). Plant phytoglobins also regulate NO
accumulation by functioning as NO dioxygenases, metabolizing
NO to nitrate. Studies also suggest
its role during plant–
microbe interaction in controlling NO bioactivity (Shimoda
et al., 2009; Bai et al., 2016). PHYTOGB1 is reported as
one of the early activated during root–mycorrhizal interaction
(Hogekamp and Küster, 2013). Furthermore, PHYTOGB1, is
also demonstrated to regulate NO levels in tomato roots
during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis with R. irregularis in
order to promote and control the interaction (Martínez-Medina
et al., 2019). Overall, the role(s) of NO in the arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi still remains elusive and its regulation is
yet unclear. In arbuscular mycorrhizae interaction, another NO
detoxiﬁcation gene VfLb29 in Vicia faba is also upregulated
to repress defense response. Therefore, the best example of
the NO as a signaling molecule in plant–microbe interaction
is during the process of biological nitrogen ﬁxation. The
process of nitrogen ﬁxation is symbiotic association between

These rhizobia may be free living or may be associated
with epiphytes and endophytes. In some cases, they can also
establish endocellular symbiosis with legumes (Masson-Boivin
et al., 2009). Thus, the role of NO as a potential signaling
molecule during plant–microbe interaction is highlighted in
several studies.

NO-MEDIATED LEGUME–RHIZOBIA
SYMBIOSIS

The involvement of NO in legume–rhizobia symbiosis has been
thoroughly studied in the last decade. NO is involved at almost
every step of the interaction between the legume host and
rhizobia (Figure 1). Legume–rhizobium symbiosis is established
following the recognition of rhizobia by the plants and the
formation of root nodules that host the bacteria for nitrogen
ﬁxation. Nodule prevents the inhibition of nitrogenase activity
by providing low oxygen environment. The process of nodulation
begins with the production of bacterial nodulation factors (Nod-
factors) in response to the chemical signals released by the

other responses downstream (Geurts and Bisseling, 2002). The
growth of rhizobia induces root hair curling and the formation
of infection thread which is a tubular and intracellular structure.
Plant hormones cytokinin and auxin induce the formation
of infection thread (Roy et al., 2020). The reproduction of
rhizobia allows the continuous growth of rhizobia from where
it reaches to the nodule primordium after reaching the base
of the root hair cells (Geurts and Bisseling, 2002). Thereafter,
the bacterial cells are released into the parenchyma cells of the
nodule and the diﬀerentiation of bacterial cells to bacteroids
begins. At this stage, morphological and physiological changes
are required for this transformation. In the entire nodulation
process, the involvement of NO is well documented. NO was
reported to be induced at early stages (4 h post inoculation)
but not at 10 and 24 h of plant–rhizobia interactions in
Lotus japonicus–Mesorhizobium loti and Medicago sativa–Ensifer
meliloti suggesting its role in signal recognition (Nagata et al.,
2008). Similar results about NO induction and involvement
during symbiosis establishment were observed in Medicago
truncatula–E. meliloti symbiosis by another group (Del Giudice
et al., 2011). Additionally, they have also reported NO detection
during curling of root hair and formation of infection thread 2
and 6 days post-infection, respectively. Furthermore, scavenging

the endogenously produced NO in the infection thread delays the
nodule development.

ROLE OF SILICON IN PLANT–MICROBE
INTERACTION

Signiﬁcant quantity of silicon present in the soil makes it the
second most abundant element on the earth’s crust, and hence
studies were carried out to understand its role in the rhizosphere.
It was discovered that silicon could not only increase the
biomass production but also had role in enhancing tolerance to
biotic and abiotic stresses, thus supporting plants with stability
and protection (Luyckx et al., 2017; López-Pérez et al., 2018).
Interestingly, a study also discovered silicon uptake transporters
from some legumes like soybean which were similar to the
silicon transporters in hyper accumulating grasses (Deshmukh
et al., 2013). The abundance of silicon in the rhizosphere and
its role in plants lead to the investigations on the role of
silicon in root nodulation and nitrogen ﬁxation which started
about 21 years back. The ﬁrst study in Vigna unguiculate
reported that silicon signiﬁcantly aﬀected root nodulation and
nitrogen ﬁxation depending upon the concentration of silicon,
its forms (metasilicic acid or silicic acid), and growing substrate

NO in Rhizospheric Plant-Microbe Interactions

FIGURE 2 | Nitric oxide network underground. Communication is established between plants and microbes through signals transmitted by microbes [such as plant
growth regulators (PGRs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) from microbes and similar signal transmission from host
plants]. The signals from the host include ﬂavonoids, PGRs, and exudates from the roots and aerial parts of the plant like 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid
(ACC) and tryptophan. At every step, nitric oxide mediates the signaling and helps establish their interaction. Role of silicon in enhancing nitrogen ﬁxation also leaves
speculations about its relation with NO in mediating the signaling events.

(liquid culture or sand culture) (Nelwamondo and Dakora,
1999). Later on, the same group reported that other than
aﬀecting nodule numbers and nitrogen ﬁxation, silicon also
aﬀected the internal structure of the nodule. An increase in
the size of peribacteroid space and cell wall thickness at high
concentrations was reported along with an increase in the
number of bacteroids and symbiosomes (Nelwamondo et al.,
2001). A characteristic feature of silicon integration in most
of the high silicon accumulating plants is an increase in cell
wall thickness (Kumar et al., 2017). Interestingly, reports of the
presence of silicon in the root nodules were also observed in
Cajanus cajan (pigeonpea) genotypes (Garg and Singh, 2018).
Nodule activity was promoted in two diﬀerent genotypes of
pigeonpea through the production of leghemoglobin. Another
study in M. sativa also demonstrated the positive impact of
silicon on root nodulation and also found it to be involved
in biosynthesis of foliar amino acids (Johnson et al., 2017).
Overall, it is clear that silicon employs beneﬁcial impact on the
symbiotic traits.

Speculations about

the joint eﬀects of silicon and NO
have been suggested recently. Combination of silicon and
NO application in maize plants under cadmium stress is
reported to increase plant growth and reduce cadmium uptake,
accumulation, translocation, and bioaccumulation factors (Liu
et al., 2020). However, the combined eﬀect of silicon and

NO in promoting root–microbiome interaction remains to be
elucidated (Figure 2).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PROSPECTS

Rhizosphere is the area around a plant root inhabited by a
diverse population of microorganisms; however, only the unique
population can inﬂuence or can be inﬂuenced by the chemical
signals released by either of them. Recent research has shown that
NO participates in early basal signaling during plant–bacterial
interactions. Bacteria and plants share several features of NO-
producing pathways which suggests that NO acts as a signaling
molecule during plant–microbe association.

Nitric oxide has been thoroughly studied as a signaling
molecule in the last decade. NO may be produced endogenously
by plant cells or may be generated as a result of activity of soil
microorganisms. Soils are an important source of NO, and the
presence of inorganic fertilizers can aﬀect NO emissions into the
environment. Since NO is a direct intermediate of nitriﬁcation
and denitriﬁcation processes carried out by microorganisms
during nitrogen ﬁxation (Payne, 1981; Skiba and Smith, 1993;
Feelisch and Martin, 1995), it suggests the possible contribution
of roots and microbes in NO production and inﬂuencing the

(Molina-Favero et al., 2007). Furthermore, research needs to be
conducted in understanding the role of silicon in plant–microbe
signaling along with its combined eﬀect with NO in mediating
the microbial communication underground.
