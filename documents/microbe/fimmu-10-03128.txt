Most animals maintain mutually beneﬁcial symbiotic relationships with their intestinal
microbiota. Resident microbes in the gastrointestinal tract breakdown indigestible food,
provide essential nutrients, and, act as a barrier against invading microbes, such
as the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Over the last decades, our knowledge of
V. cholerae pathogenesis, colonization, and transmission has increased tremendously.
A number of animal models have been used to study how V. cholerae interacts
with host-derived resources to support gastrointestinal colonization. Here, we review
studies on host-microbe interactions and how infection with V. cholerae disrupts these
interactions, with a focus on contributions from the Drosophila melanogaster model.
We will discuss studies that highlight the connections between symbiont, host, and
V. cholerae metabolism; crosstalk between V. cholerae and host microbes; and the
impact of the host immune system on the lethality of V. cholerae infection. These studies
suggest that V. cholerae modulates host immune-metabolic responses in the ﬂy and
improves Vibrio ﬁtness through competition with intestinal microbes.

INTRODUCTION

Background
A complex set of interactions among host intestinal cells, and gut-resident microbes, impacts
the viability of all participants. For example, commensal microbes consume intestinal nutrients,
and generate metabolites that inﬂuence development, growth, metabolism, and immune system
function in the host (1–8). Introduction of microbes with pathogenic potential to the gut lumen,
or rearrangements to the composition or distribution of gut microbial communities, can have
substantial impacts on intestinal homeostasis for the host (9). In particular, shifts in niche
occupancy by gut bacteria, or alterations to metabolic outputs from the gut microbiome, can result
in the development of severe intestinal disease (10–13). For example, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,
a common human commensal, cleaves host glycans to produce fucose, a sugar that modulates
the virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (14). Despite the importance of regulated
molecular exchanges among host and microbial cells for host ﬁtness and microbial function, our
knowledge of pathogen-commensal interactions in the context of immune-metabolic regulation
and intestinal disease is still quite limited. To fully understand such complex, multipartite
interactions, it is essential that we deploy all relevant experimental systems at our disposal.

Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable experimental tool for studying host-microbe interactions.
Lab-raised strains of Drosophila associate with a limited number of bacterial taxa (15–17),

dominated by easily cultivated Acetobacter and Lactobacillus
strains
that are accessible to genetic manipulation, and
deployment in large-scale screens. Researchers have access to
simple protocols for the establishment of ﬂies with a deﬁned
intestinal microbiome (18, 19), and there is an abundance
of publicly available lines for the genetic manipulation of
ﬂy intestinal function. Combined, these advantages allowed
researchers to make substantial breakthroughs in understanding
how ﬂies interact with intestinal bacteria (20). Importantly, given
the extent to which genetic regulators of intestinal homeostasis
are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates (20, 21),
discoveries made with the ﬂy have the potential to illuminate
foundational aspects of host-microbe interactions. However,
there are several key diﬀerences to note between ﬂies and
vertebrates that partially limit the utility of the ﬂy model.
Speciﬁcally, ﬂies lack lymphocyte-based adaptive defenses, and
the ﬂy microbiome is considerably diﬀerent to that reported
in vertebrates.

Antimicrobial Defenses in the Fly Intestine
Drosophila integrate physical, chemical, proliferative, and
antibacterial strategies to neutralize intestinal microbes, and
prevent systemic infection of the host (Figure 1) (22, 23). The
chitinous peritrophic matrix lines the midgut, and presents a
physical barrier against bacterial invasion (24), similar to the
mucus lining of the vertebrate intestinal tract. The germline-
antibacterial defense
encoded immune deﬁciency (IMD)
pathway, a signaling pathway similar to the mammalian
Tumor Necrosis Factor pathway
(25), detects bacterial
diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan, and acts through
the NF-κB transcription factor family member, Relish, to induce
expression of antimicrobial peptides (26–29). At the same time,
Dual Oxidase (Duox) and NADPH Oxidase (Nox) protect the
host from gut bacteria through the generation of bactericidal
reactive oxygen species (30, 31). Evolutionarily conserved
growth regulatory pathways respond to damage of epithelial
cells by promoting a compensatory growth and diﬀerentiation of
intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in infected ﬂies (32–35). This adaptive
repair mechanism maintains the epithelial barrier, and prevents
systemic infection of the host. Combined, these antibacterial
defenses protect the host from infection, and maintain beneﬁcial
relationships between the ﬂy and their gut microbiome.

The Drosophila Microbiome
The ﬂy microbiome is transmitted horizontally through the
deposition of bacteria on the outer surface of
freshly laid
embryos, and is maintained through the ingestion of food
contaminated with bacteria (36). Gut bacteria regulate Drosophila
intestinal homeostasis by aﬀecting metabolism, growth, and
immunity in the host. Interactions between the host and gut
microbiota have been extensively covered in several recent
reviews (20, 37–39), and will not be discussed in detail here.
In brief, detailed studies have uncovered roles for symbiotic
Lactobacillus and Acetobacter species in the control of ﬂy
metabolism and growth (40–42). For example, a dehydrogenase
activity in Acetobacter pomorum, produces acetic acid that
regulates insulin signaling, carbohydrate, and lipid levels in the

FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the adult Drosophila midgut.
Intestinal bacteria are contained within the lumen by a chitinous peritrophic
matrix (PM). Bacteria diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan activates the
immune deﬁciency (IMD) pathway in enterocytes (EC), leading to production of
antimicrobial peptides (AMP). In enteroendocrine cells (EE), IMD controls
expression of the metabolism-regulatory hormone Tachykinin (Tk). Epithelial
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidases (NOX) also
contribute to bacterial killing while cues from the bacterial microbiome promote
the growth of intestinal progenitor cells (IPC), composes of intestinal stem cells
(ISC), and enteroblasts (EB).

host (40). In addition to the eﬀects of individual symbionts on
nutrient allocations in the host, interactions among bacterial
communities have signiﬁcant eﬀects on host metabolism, growth,
and physiology (43–47). Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) has
emerged as a particularly useful tool to study interactions
between the host, the intestinal microbiota, and an enteric
pathogen. A pioneering study in 2005 established that ﬂies are
susceptible to oral infection with V. cholerae, dying within a few
day from a diarrheal disease with symptoms similar to cholera in
humans (48). The genetic tractability of the ﬂy and V. cholerae
established this system as a very attractive model to identify
key host and microbial determinants of pathogenesis. In the
following years, a number of studies uncovered complex roles
for metabolism, host immunity, epithelial growth, and microbial
antagonism in the outcome of V. cholerae pathogenesis in the ﬂy.
In this review, we will discuss key ﬁndings from these studies,
and outline what they tell us about host-microbe interactions in
general, and V. cholerae-mediated pathogenesis in particular.

Vibrio cholerae: Pandemics and
Pathogenicity
Vibrio cholerae is a curved, Gram-negative member of the
Vibrionaceae family of Proteobacteria (49). It inhabits aquatic
environments, and copepods and chironomids are reported
as natural reservoirs in marine ecosystems (50, 51). Intestinal
colonization by V. cholerae causes the diarrheal disease, cholera,
and is considered a substantial public health threat, especially
in countries with poor sanitation and contaminated water (52).

Vibrio cholerae Pathogenesis in Drosophila

The ﬁrst cholera pandemic emerged in 1817, with an expansion
of cholera beyond the Indian subcontinent (53). Since then,
the world has witnessed an additional six pandemics, with the
seventh pandemic ongoing (54). Models that estimate cholera
burden predict ∼3 million cases of disease per year, resulting in
roughly 100,000 deaths (55).

Vibrio cholerae

strains are divided into classical and
non-classical serotypes, with classical ones expressing the O1
antigen on their surface (56, 57). Classical serotypes are further
subdivided into two biotypes—classical and El Tor—that diﬀer
in the expression of a number of markers, such as hemolysins
(58–61). The outbreak of epidemic cholera that spread through
southeast Asia in 1992 is caused by the non-classical strain
of V. cholerae 0139 (62), whereas the ongoing pandemic that
originated in Indonesia in 1961 is caused by the El Tor
biotype (63). El Tor causes a milder cholera disease (64), with
infected individuals frequently remaining asymptomatic early in
infection (65).

Vibrio cholerae encodes several virulence factors that regulate
survival, colonization, and pathogenicity (66–69). Cholera toxin
(CT) is a hexameric adenosine diphosphate-ribosyl transferase
that contains one A subunit surrounded by ﬁve B subunits
(70, 71). Upon release into the intestinal
lumen via a type
two secretion system (72), the B pentamer of CT interacts
with host GM1 ganglosides (73), permitting toxin endocytosis,
and a subsequent cytosolic release of the A1 subunit (74). A1
ADP-ribosylates the Gs alpha subunit, locking Gαs in an active
state (75). Active Gαs elevates adenylate cyclase activity, greatly
increasing levels of 3
-cyclic AMP, resulting in excess protein
kinase A (PKA) activity (76). PKA stimulates an eﬄux of chloride
ions through the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator channel (77), leading to an uncontrolled ﬂow of water,
sodium and potassium ions into the intestinal
lumen. This
extreme, and rapid, dehydration results in the voluminous rice-
water diarrhea that hallmarks cholera disease (78). In addition
to CT, V. cholerae require the toxin co-regulated pilus virulence
factor for pathogenesis (79). Toxin co-regulated pilus is a type
IV pilus system that mediates colonization of the small intestine
by a self-associate mechanism that supports the formation
of bacterial microcolonies (80). Toxin co-regulated pilus also
serves as the receptor for the CTXϕ bacteriophage. CTXϕ
encodes ctxAB, and converts benign V. cholerae to pathogenic
strains. The ability to synthesize toxin co-regulated pilus
is advantageous for V. cholerae in aquatic environments,

resistance among classical (82) and non-classical (83) strain of
V. cholerae complicate treatment of the disease. Therefore, new
antibacterial strategies that eﬀectively target V. cholerae virulence
factors are critical to contain this deadly disease. Over the last
century, a variety of animal models that include rabbits, mice,
ﬁsh, and ﬂies, have been used to study Vibrio-host interactions
and each of these models have added to our understanding

of virulence, host responses to infection, interactions between
Vibrio and host microbes, and cholera vaccine development.

The Rabbit Model
The ﬁrst animal model to study V. cholerae dates back to
1884 when Nicati and Rietschin inoculated V. cholerae into the
duodenum of guinea pigs, resulting in cholera-like symptoms
(84). Since then, both infant and adult rabbit models of
cholera have been widely used by researchers (85–87). As
adult rabbits are resistant to oral infection with V. cholerae,
the pathogen is typically introduced to the animal by ligated
ileal loop surgery. In this technique, the small intestine of the
rabbit is sealed at two ends, and the pathogen is delivered by
injection into the ligated loop, allowing direct measurement
of intestinal ﬂuid secretion (88). The rabbit model has been
very instructive for understanding V. cholerae distribution in
the small
intestine during infection, the importance of the
mucosal barrier to prevent systemic infection of V. cholerae,
and mechanisms of V. cholerae attachment to the intestinal
epithelium (89, 90). As infant rabbits are capable of developing
toxin co-regulated pilus-dependent cholera, they have been
useful to study the reactogenicity associated with developing
live attenuated V. cholerae vaccines as well (91). However,
despite these advances, Vibrio pathogenesis studies using the
rabbit ligated ileal loop model are labor-intensive, and do not
replicate the normal route of infection. An alternative, oro-gastric
infection model with infant rabbits pre-treated with the stomach
acid production inhibitor, Cimetidine, allows oral infection and
provides a valuable adult mammal model that circumvents needs
for surgical interventions (87).

The Mouse Model
The infant or suckling mouse in commonly used to study
V. cholerae pathogenesis (92). In this model, infant mice are
infected via the oro-gastric route. In the infant mouse, the
intestinal microbiome has not fully developed, allowing V.
cholerae to colonize the host with diminished colonization
resistance from commensal microbes. Studies working with
infant mice have uncovered essential virulence factors of
V. cholerae. For example, the toxin co-regulated pilus (93), and
ToxR (69), which regulates toxin co-regulated pilus expression
were originally characterized in the suckling mouse model.
The adult mouse model was also a signiﬁcant contributor to
understanding the mechanisms of V. cholerae pathogenesis using
accessory toxins such as hemolysin, hemagglutinin/protease,
and multifunctional auto-processing RTX toxin (94). These
observations were important to understand the ability of V.
cholerae to express toxins other than CT to prolong its
colonization in the host without severe diarrheal symptoms.
However, this model comes with some limitations, as suckling
mice do not develop watery diarrhea, and lymphocyte-based
immune defenses are not fully developed in the host (95–97).
Furthermore, as infant mice are separated from their mothers,
they have a limited survival and reduced timeframe for research
performance. Adult mice are less eﬃcient for cholera studies
as they are naturally resistant to V. cholerae colonization (98).
Thus, manipulations such as removal of intestinal microbes

surgery (100), are necessary for colonization of adult mice

V. cholerae and an arthropod host. As studies with this model
progress, it will be interesting to determine how such virulence
factors impact pathogenesis in vertebrate models.

The Zebraﬁsh Model
tract of ﬁsh in the
V. cholerae is found in the intestinal
wild, where the bacteria degrades macromolecules ingested
by ﬁsh via its chitinase and protease, building a commensal
relationship between ﬁsh and V. cholerae (101). Analysis of
cholera patients from an outbreak in 1997 showed that dried
ﬁsh consumption was signiﬁcantly associated with the spread
of disease, implicating ﬁsh as potential vector for V. cholerae
(102). Building on associations between ﬁsh and V. cholerae
the zebraﬁsh, Danio rerio, has recently been
in the wild,
developed recently as a natural host model to study V. cholerae
(103). Importantly, pathogenic strains of V. cholerae cause a
cholera-like disease characterized by host intestinal colonization,
epithelial destruction, diarrhea, and the expulsion of
live
pathogens (103). Unlike the adult rabbit model, researchers do
not require surgical interventions prior to infection, and in
contrast to the mouse model, investigators are not restricted to
working with antibiotic-treated juveniles (103, 104). Fish and
humans have similarly complex microbiomes that shift with age
and diet (105), making ﬁsh a useful model to study interactions
between commensal bacteria and the invading pathogen (106).
However, it is important to note that ﬁsh cannot be raised in
axenic conditions, and it is technically challenging to generate
and maintain ﬁsh populations with fully deﬁned microbiota for
sustained periods.

The Drosophila Model
Insects such as chironmids (107) and houseﬂies (108) are
candidate reservoirs of V. cholerae, and some studies suggest
a correlation between disease transmission and increases in ﬂy
population, during cholera outbreaks, or in areas where the
disease is endemic (109). Given the association of V. cholerae with
arthropod vectors, researchers tested the utility of Drosophila
as a model to characterize V. cholerae pathogenesis. Drosophila
infections typically involve oral delivery of the pathogen, or
introduction of the pathogen into the body cavity of the ﬂy
through a septic injury (110). In contrast to non-pathogenic
Vibrio strains, injection of V. cholerae into the body cavity
resulted in a rapid death of infected ﬂies, raising the possibility
of using ﬂies as a model to study V. cholerae pathogenesis
(111). In a foundational study from 2005, researchers showed
that continuous feeding of adult ﬂies with V. cholerae caused a
cholera-like disease characterized by loss of weight, and rapid
death that required a functional Gαs in the host (48), establishing
ﬂies as a valuable model to characterize V. cholerae pathogenesis.
However, in contrast to vertebrates, ctx mutants remain lethal
to ﬂies, suggesting CT-independent pathogenic mechanisms
in adult ﬂies. Furthermore, Vibrio polysaccharide-dependent
bioﬁlm formation is important for persistent colonization of
the ﬂy rectum and for V. cholerae-mediated lethality (112),
whereas Vibrio polysaccharides interfere with colonization of the
host intestine (113). Thus, the ﬂy is a useful tool to identify
uncharacterized virulence factors that aﬀect interactions between

Vibrio cholerae and the IMD Pathway
The IMD pathway modiﬁes expression of host genes that
control processes as diverse as bacterial killing, metabolism, and
intestinal homeostasis (114–121). Mutations in the IMD pathway
are linked with intestinal phenotypes that implicate IMD as a
critical modiﬁer of host-bacteria interactions. For example, IMD
is required to survive enteric infections with entemopathogenic
Pseudomonas entomophila (122). Additionally, IMD pathway
mutants are characterized by changes to the composition of
the intestinal microbiome, modiﬁed distribution of live bacteria
throughout the intestine (123), and elevated bacterial loads in
the intestine (17, 123–127). It is tempting to speculate that
IMD controls bacterial populations through the direct release
of antimicrobial peptides into the gut lumen. This hypothesis
is supported by a recent study that conﬁrmed a failure to
contain infectious Gram-negative and fungal pathogens in
ﬂies that lack antimicrobial peptide genes (29). However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that IMD-dependent control of
bacterial populations includes inputs from other processes such
as intestinal metabolism. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies
have revealed links between immune and insulin activity in
several models (128–132), including ﬂies (120, 133–138), and
IMD activity controls expression of the metabolism-regulatory
peptide, Tachykinin, in enteroendocrine cells of the anterior
midgut (117). In addition to metabolic deregulation, IMD
pathway mutants are characterized by accelerated proliferation
of intestinal progenitor cells, intestinal tissue dysplasia, and early
death (34). Many of these phenotypes are reverted by elimination
of the gut microbiome (124), conﬁrming links between IMD, gut
microbial composition, and intestinal health. As ﬂies are highly
amenable to modiﬁcations of intestinal gene activity, Drosophila
has emerged as a particularly valuable tools to characterize links
between host epithelial immunity, and V. cholerae pathogenesis.
In ﬂies, reactive oxygen species generation does not appear to
aﬀect V. cholerae pathogenesis (139). In contrast, septic injury
of adult ﬂies with V. cholerae causes elevated expression of
IMD-responsive antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, induced
expression of antimicrobial peptide genes attenuated V. cholerae
pathogenesis in the septic injury model (111). These observations
suggest that IMD will have protective eﬀects against V. cholerae.
However, characterization of ﬂies challenged with V. cholerae
through the natural, oral route, revealed an unexpected link
between host immunity and pathogenesis. Speciﬁcally, although
infection promotes the expression of IMD-responsive
oral
antimicrobial peptides in the intestine, IMD pathway mutants
displayed an enhanced survival after oral
infection with V.
cholerae (140), indicating that host immune activity contributes
to V. cholerae pathogenesis. Follow-up work showed that
mutations in the IMD pathway have minimal eﬀects on levels
of intestinal V. cholerae (139). Nonetheless, whereas V. cholerae
inhibit ISC growth in wild-type ﬂies, ISC proliferation is
unimpaired in the intestines of V. cholerae-infected IMD pathway

mutants (139) suggesting that V. cholerae-dependent activation
of IMD inhibits ISC proliferation, accelerating host death.

Studies of links between host immunity and V. cholerae
pathogenesis uncovered an involvement of
the Drosophila
oxidation resistance 1 ortholog, mustard (mtd), in host viability
(139, 141). Mustard is a Lysine Motif domain-bearing protein
with roles in pupal eclosion (142). A gain-of-function mutant,
mtdEY04695, that increases expression of a nuclear localized
mustard isoform, signiﬁcantly improves the survival duration
of ﬂies infected with V. cholerae (141). Molecular work
showed that mtdEY04695 mutants process the IMD-responsive
NF- κB transcription factor Relish normally, and express most
antimicrobial peptides to wild type levels after infection (139,
141). However, genome-wide transcriptional studies uncovered
broad overlaps between the expression proﬁles of mtdEY04695 and
an IMD pathway mutant, including diminished expression of the
diptericin antimicrobial peptide, suggesting interactions between
mustard function and IMD activity. Similar to IMD pathway
mutants, mtdEY04695 ﬂies are capable of progenitor cell growth
after infection, supporting the notion of links between immune
activity, ISC proliferation, and host survival. Looking forward,
it will be interesting to characterize the immune phenotypes of
loss-of-function mutations in the mtd locus.

A recent study from our group examined the consequences of
IMD inactivation in deﬁned intestinal cell types for host viability
after infection with V. cholerae (143). We found that inhibition
of IMD in diﬀerentiated enterocytes signiﬁcantly extended the
survival times of infected ﬂies, whereas inhibition of IMD in
the progenitor cell compartment shortened survival times. These
observations suggest that the activity of IMD in enterocytes is
suﬃcient to enhance V. cholerae pathogenesis. The mechanism
by which immune activity inﬂuences V. cholerae pathogenesis
requires clariﬁcation. In this context, we note that IMD is
required for the delamination of damaged cells in the intestinal
epithelium (119). As V. cholerae causes extensive damage to the
midgut epithelium (139, 140, 144), we consider it is possible that
V. cholerae kills the host, in part, by activating IMD-dependent
sloughing of the epithelium. In this untested model, excess
delamination eﬀectively disrupts the epithelial barrier, preventing
the transduction of growth cues to progenitor cells, and leading
to systemic infection and host death. However, we cannot
exclude alternative, and potentially non-exclusive mechanistic
links, such as metabolic dysfunction, between immune activity
and host mortality. In particular, there is a considerable amount
of data linking intestinal metabolism to disease progression in
infected ﬂies.

Vibrio cholerae and Host Metabolism
The gut microbiota modiﬁes metabolism in Drosophila, with
implications for host growth and development (40, 42, 145).
For example, symbiotic Ap are a source of thiamine during
development (146). Additionally, Ap-derived acetate stimulates
insulin signaling activity in the ﬂy (40). The Drosophila
insulin response pathway is highly similar to the vertebrate
counterpart (147), and Ap-dependent control of insulin activity
aﬀects key developmental processes such as intestinal growth,
size regulation, and storage of energy (40). Similar to Ap,

symbiotic Lactobacillus plantarum plays an important role in the
regulation of larval growth. In this case, Lp activates intestinal
peptidases, at least partially in an IMD-dependent manner
(148), to promote the uptake of amino acids from the larval
growth medium, thereby activating the Target of Rapamycin
complex, and promoting larval growth (42). When considering
microbial control of host metabolism, it is important to note that
higher-order interactions in a complex community of intestinal
bacteria impact host health and ﬁtness (43). For example,
interactions between symbiotic Acetobacter and Lactobacillus
species inﬂuence lipid homeostasis in adult ﬂies (149).

A genetic screen for V. cholerae mutants with impaired
pathogenesis in ﬂies identiﬁed the CrbRS two-component system
as a modiﬁer of host killing (150). CrbRS is composed of the CrbS
histidine kinase sensor, and the CrbR response regulator. CrbRS
controls expression of acetyl CoA-synthase (acs1), a bacterial
regulator of acetate consumption. In E. coli, expression of
acs1 activates the acetate switch, whereby bacteria switch from
production to consumption of the short-chain fatty acid, acetate
(151). The acetate switch is conserved in V. cholerae, as mutations
in crbR, crbS, or acs1 prevent consumption of acetate by V.
cholerae in liquid culture (150, 152). These observations suggest
that V. cholerae-dependent virulence may involve consumption
of intestinal acetate by the pathogen. Consistent with that
hypothesis, provision of dietary acetate was suﬃcient to extend
survival times in ﬂies infected with V. cholerae. Mechanistically,
the authors showed that consumption of intestinal acetate by
wild-type V. cholerae disrupted insulin signaling in the host,
leading to intestinal steatosis and depletion of lipid stores from
the ﬂy fat body, an insect organ with functional similarities to
the vertebrate liver and white adipose tissue (153). Removal of
lipids from the ﬂy medium prevented steatosis, and extended host
viability, conﬁrming a role for lipid homeostasis in V. cholerae
pathogenesis. Interestingly, CrbS is expressed during V. cholerae
infections in mice and humans (154, 155), raising the possibility
that pathogenic consumption of intestinal acetate is a general
virulence strategy of V. cholerae.

Links between metabolism and pathogenesis extend beyond
short-chain fatty acid consumption. For example, mutations of
the V. cholerae glycine cleavage system also attenuate virulence
in the ﬂy model (156). These mutants colonize ﬂy intestines
with equal eﬃciency as wild-type V. cholerae, indicating that
the phenotype is likely a consequence of an increased ability
of the host to tolerate infection. In line with this hypothesis,
glycine cleavage mutants fail to suppress ISC division, and
do not aﬀect lipid levels in fat tissue or homeostasis. Instead,
glycine cleavage mutants have increased levels of methionine-
sulfoxide in their intestines, and dietary supplementation with
the host Methionine
methionine-sulfoxide, or mutation of
sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) gene extended host viability and
restored lipid homeostasis to ﬂies infected with V. cholerae,
implicating methionine-sulfoxide availability in pathogenesis.

Metabolic regulation is also sensitive to quorum-sensing by
V. cholerae. A recent study showed that quorum sensing in
the El tor C6706 strain minimizes pathogenesis in ﬂies, as
deletion of the quorum-sensing master regulator, hapR, increased
pathogenesis (157). HapR suppresses the expression of CT

(158), and toxin co-regulated pilus virulence factors (159), and
inhibits expression of Vibrio polysaccharide (160, 161), a bioﬁlm
exopolysaccharide that enables colonization of the Drosophila
rectum (112). The elevated pathogenesis observed in 1hapR
strains was not the result of increased bioﬁlm formation. Instead,
the phenotype appears to be the consequence of increased
succinate uptake by 1hapR due to elevated expression of the
Vibrio cholerae INDY succinate transporter. Consistent with this
model, supplementation of the infection medium with succinate
signiﬁcantly extended survival times of ﬂies infected with 1hapR.
Similar to phenotypes associated with methionine-sulfoxide, and
acetate, succinate consumption by V. cholerae was associated with
depletion of lipid stores from the fat body, suggesting a possible
role for inter-organ regulation of lipid homeostasis in the survival
of infection with V. cholerae.

Vibrio cholerae and ISC Growth
Much of the data above describe the phenotypic impacts of
V. cholerae-mediated consumption of intestinal metabolites.
However, it is important to remember that V. cholerae competes
with gut-resident bacteria for attachment to the intestinal niche
(162). Thus, V. cholerae-dependent displacement of intestinal
bacteria can also aﬀect the proﬁle of metabolites available to the
host. For example, V. cholerae encodes a type six secretion system
(T6SS) that delivers an array of toxins to susceptible prokaryotic,
and eukaryotic, prey (163–165). Two studies from our group
implicated the T6SS in Drosophila pathogenesis mediated by
the El Tor strain, C6706. The ﬁrst study showed that the T6SS
targets symbiotic Acetobacter pasteurianus for killing, and that
the T6SS contributes to host killing (144). T6SS-dependent killing
of the host requires the presence of Ap, and association of
adult ﬂies exclusively with T6SS-refractory Lactobacillus species
is suﬃcient to extend the viability of C6706-infected hosts. These
data indicate that T6SS-mediated killing of ﬂies proceeds through
an indirect route that requires host association with Acetobacter.
More recently, we showed that the T6SS also aﬀects epithelial
renewal
in infected ﬂies. In agreement with previous work
(139), we showed that V. cholerae causes extensive damage
to the midgut epithelium, but fails to activate compensatory
proliferation in basal progenitor cells (166). Removal of the
T6SS diminishes epithelial damage, and restores renewal

interactions between the T6SS and the host epithelium, as
removal of the intestinal microbiome restores renewal capacity

to midguts
indicate that the T6SS contributes to V. cholerae-mediated
inhibition of epithelial renewal in a manner that requires a
gut microbiome. In these assays, inhibition of renewal is not
a simple consequence of interactions between V. cholerae and
symbiotic Acetobacter. Instead, inhibition of renewal required
association of infected ﬂies with a tripartite community of gut
bacteria, consisting of Ap, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lp, suggesting
that T6SS-dependent arrest of progenitor growth is the result of
complex interactions between the pathogen and a community
of symbionts. Interestingly, quorum sensing appears to be an
important factor in progenitor renewal. In vertebrates, the master
quorum sensor regulator, hapR is not expressed at early stages

of infection, where V. cholerae are present in low density. The
absence of HapR allows for production of the toxin coregulated
pilus, and CT, resulting in disease. As V. cholerae numbers
increase, quorum sensing-dependent production of HapR results
in a repression of virulence genes. In our studies, we used a C6706
strain with low hapR expression (167), allowing for expression

FIGURE 2 | Schematic representation of the impact of pathogenic Vibrio
cholerae on metabolism, growth and immunity in the adult Drosophila midgut.
For clarity, we have broken the individual responses into separate panels,
although it is important to note that growth, metabolism and immunity share
regulatory components in vivo. By consuming metabolites such as methionine
sulfoxide (MetO) and acetate, V. cholerae affects lipid homeostasis contributing
to death. At the same time, V. cholerae impairs IPC growth pathways,
although it is unclear how this affects symbiont-dependent growth responses
(indicated with a question mark). Finally, the host IMD pathway contributes to
pathogenesis by impairing IPC growth, and possibly by affecting epithelial
turnover (indicated by a question mark).

of virulence genes in the ﬂy. In contrast, earlier studies with
several C6706 strains that express hapR failed to arrest progenitor
growth, and were not pathogenic to ﬂies (157). Mutation of hapR
in these strains restored pathogenesis, and blocked proliferation.
In total, these studies hint at a sophisticated interplay between
quorum sensing, bacterial competition, and epithelial renewal in
the host. It will be interesting to determine the mechanistic basis
for these interactions in future studies.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION

In this review, we have discussed the utility of D. melanogaster as
an experimental model to understand V. cholerae pathogenesis.
In the last 15 years, work with the ﬂy uncovered a complex
series of
