INTRODUCTION

Environmental pollution is one of the world’s most severe problems that we have to face nowadays.
This has caused great concern globally, and it is urgent to develop more efﬁcient methods to handle
environmental issues. Photocatalytic oxidation and microbe bioremediation are considered as two
promising methods and have been extensively explored (Lin et al., 2012; Karim et al., 2021).
Photocatalytic oxidation-based approaches mainly utilize the photogenerated holes and electrons on
the surfaces of photocatalytic materials to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which will then
oxidatively decompose pollutants (Byrne et al., 2018). Photocatalytic oxidation provides the
possibility of utilizing sustainable and green solar energy to remove pollutants. As for microbe-

so-called photocatalytic
material–microbe hybrid (PMH) system (Du et al., 2020). In
2016, the PMH system is ﬁrstly built by Professor Peidong Yang’
group in Berkeley, University of California, to realize solar-to-

equivalents to synthesize products. Currently, PMH systems are
mainly applied for H2 evolution (Jiang et al., 2018; Wei et al.,
2018), CO2 conversion (Ye et al., 2019), N2 ﬁxation (Wang B.
et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019), and chemical manufacturing (Guo
et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020).

Interestingly, this PMH system has also shown great potential
in treating environmental pollutants in some very recent reports
(Wang X. et al., 2019). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there is
no review summarizing these advances. Therefore, we summarize
the current advances of using the PMH system in environmental
remediation and compare it with another similar system, the
intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB).
Current research gaps and future perspectives are also given in
the end. We believe this review will be helpful for the future
development of this direction.

APPLICATION OF PMHS IN
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

Most organic contaminants can be gradually biodegraded and
completely mineralized through the aerobic respiration of
microbes. Yet, the conventional aerobic treatment increases
the energy consumption because of
the high aeration rate
during the operation process (Mitsugu and Yasumoto, 2003).
In addition, some pollutants with oxidative nature (such as
refractory azo dyes and halogenated organic and nitroaromatic
tend to be degraded reductively rather than
compounds)
oxidatively (Liu P.-C. et al., 2020). Therefore, it is meaningful
to develop new technologies which can provide adequate
reducing power to fulﬁll the reduction degradation of these
pollutants under anaerobic conditions. In this context, Xiao
et al. (2019) coupled an electrochemically active bacterium,
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, with the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst to
build a PMH system, which can remove almost 100% of 15 mg/L
rhodamine B after 7 days under visible light irradiation. Blocking
the Mtr
respiratory pathway (a transmembrane electron
transport chain) or dosing additional riboﬂavin (an electron
shuttle) could interfere with the extracellular electron transfer
of S. oneidensis MR-1 and decrease the degradation rate of
rhodamine B. The authors believed that the photogenerated
holes on the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst were scavenged by the
electrons released from S. oneidensis MR-1, and thereby, the
photogenerated electrons on the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst were

efﬁciently transferred to rhodamine B and achieve the photo-
reductive degradation (Figure 1A). Xiao et al. also used this PMH
system to reductively decompose
p-chlorophenol under
anaerobic circumstances. The results of density functional
theory calculations further proved that the electrochemically
active bacterium S. oneidensis MR-1 could act as a biological
hole scavenger (Liu P.-C. et al., 2020). In another of their work,
they used CdS nanocrystals instead of Ag3PO4 to combine with
S. oneidensis MR-1 and form a PMH system for the treatment of
trypan blue (Xiao et al., 2020). Again, the biogenic electrons
produced by the anaerobic respiration of S. oneidensis MR-1
eliminated the photogenerated holes on CdS nanocrystals and
maintained the ongoing photoexcitation to produce electrons,
cleaving the azo bonds in trypan blue.

Similarly, to degrade another azo dye, methyl orange (MO),
Huang et al. (2019) built a PMH system by precipitating CdS
nanoparticles on the surface of Geobacter sulfurreducens (an
electrochemically active bacterium). This PMH system can
light
completely degrade 40 mg/L MO after 3 h under
irradiation. Different from the mechanism proposed by Liu et al.
(2020b) and Xiao et al. (2019, 2020), Huang et al. believed that there
were two degradation pathways working simultaneously in their
PMH system (Figure 1B): (1) the photogenerated electrons were
stored
of
G. sulfurreducens, and these electrons were then transferred to
the terminal reductase for mineralizing MO; and (2) the
photogenerated electrons could be directly transferred to the
MO and degrade it. Huang et al. (2019) hypothesized that the
photogenerated holes were scavenged by the intermediates
produced during the decolorization process of MO as they
found that dosing additional sacriﬁcial reagents in the PMH
system did not affect the MO degradation rate. In the report
contributed by Chen et al. (2019), a PMH system containing CdS
nanomaterials and Thiobacillus denitriﬁcans was used to supply
electrons for the denitriﬁcation process. After 68 h of visible light
irradiation, this PMH system converted more than 72.1% of the
-N into N2O-N. Lactate was chosen as the sacriﬁcial reagent
NO3
to scavenge the photogenerated holes. The authors proposed that
the excited photoelectrons
from CdS nanomaterials were
transferred into microbes through the electron acceptors in
cell membranes like C-type cytochrome and then to those
enzymes involved in the denitriﬁcation pathway (Figure 1C).

Apart from persistent organic pollutants, the PMH system can
also be used to treat heavy metal contamination. Our group
deposited CdS nanomaterials on the surface of Bacillus
thuringiensis HM-311 (a multiple-heavy-metal-tolerant strain
isolated from heavy-metal-polluted soil (Berrazeg et al., 2019))
to form the PMH system (Zuo et al., 2021b). Then this PMH
system was operated in the simulated Cr6+ (100 mg/L) and As3+
(100 mg/L) co-contaminated water under visible light. After 24 h
of operation, 99.25% of Cr6+ was reduced. Meanwhile, As3+ was
simultaneously oxidized into As5+ by this PMH system, and up to
62.74 mg/L of As5+ was detected. We believed that with the help
of solar energy and microbial enzymatic reactions, electrons can
be transferred from heavy metal ions that need to be oxidized to
detoxify them and donated to heavy metal ions that need to be
reduced to become less toxic (Figures 1D,E). This PMH system

ions, achieving the repair of multiple metal ions in wastewater
simultaneously.

COMPARE PMH WITH ICPB

In fact, it is not the ﬁrst time that photocatalysts are combined
with microbes intimately for environmental remediation. The
group led by Professor Rittmann at Arizona State University ﬁrst
built a system which intimately coupled photocatalytic oxidation
with microbial degradation (ICPB) for wastewater treatment in
2008 (Marsolek et al., 2010). Herein, we compare the ICPB
system with the PMH system. This will help researchers
understand the differences and connections between these two
systems and apply them more properly for wastewater treatment.

and
Photocatalysts are loaded on the surface of the carriers, and
the bioﬁlms are cultivated in the carriers. The porous carrier can
adsorb refractory pollutants from the solution and enhance its
mass transfer to the surface of the photocatalysts. In the process
of photocatalytic degradation, a photocatalyst absorbs photon
energy and generates electron–hole pairs, which will cause ROS
such as (cid:129)OH and (cid:129)O2
. These ROS will attack and destroy the
refractory organic contaminants and convert
them into
biodegradable products, which are completely degraded by
the bioﬁlms afterwards (Liu J. et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020).
ICPB systems are suitable to mineralize most of the refractory
(e.g., antibiotics, dyes, and polycyclic
organic pollutants
aromatic hydrocarbons). A typical PMH system is mainly
composed of microbial cells and photocatalytic materials
deposited directly on their
surfaces. For environmental
remediation, electrochemically active bacteria are often used
in PMH systems to provide the biogenic electrons to eliminate
the photogenerated holes on the photocatalysts. In this case, the
photogenerated electrons are able to reductively degrade those
organic pollutants with oxidative natures (such as nitroaromatic
compounds and azo dyes). In the PMH system for treating
heavy metals, electrons generated by photocatalysts can be

(Zhang et al., 2016). Plus, UV light exhibits a strong killing ability
on microorganisms. Under UV light irradiation, bioﬁlms are
detached from the carriers and the soluble microbial products are
generated, which increase the turbidity of the reaction mixture.
This could in turn hinder the penetration of UV light and thereby
reduce the photocatalytic degradation efﬁciency (Zuo et al.,
2021a). Therefore, most ICPB systems are driven by visible
light now.

microbial consortium can degrade different types of organic

removing organic pollutants, electrochemically active bacteria are
usually chosen. These bacteria can provide bio-electrons via their

Providing readily biodegradable co-substrates such as acetate

will improve the microbial metabolic activity, counteract toxicity

increase of the removal rate (Bai et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2018). In
PMH systems, photogenerated holes need to be scavenged, which
will ensure the system will provide reductive electrons for
microbial synthesis or the photoreductive degradation of target
pollutants. For those PMH systems used for environmental
purposes, the hole scavengers are the electrochemically active
bacteria, which need carbon sources and electron donors such as
lactate and sodium acetate trihydrate. In our previous work, some
heavy metal ions (e.g., As3+ and Sb3+) can be used as sacriﬁcial
electron donors to maintain the continuous operation of the
PMH system (Zuo et al., 2021b).

an illuminated reactor coupled with an aeration pump, which
supplies enough oxygen for the photocatalysis oxidation and
microbial respiration. In contrast, PMH systems can work

the future. The incorporation of more biology scientists
especially with omics and synthetic biology backgrounds
will be great.

3) Electron donors, either for the microbial growth or for the
scavenging of the photogenerated holes on the photocatalysts
directly, are crucial for the continuous operation of PMH
systems. The costs of those typical hole scavengers such as
cysteine, ascorbic acid, and HEPES are too high for large-scale
application. Finding electron donors that can be regenerated
and have low cost, as well as being biocompatible, will be of
great beneﬁt to ensure economic viability and applicability of
PMH systems in environmental applications.
