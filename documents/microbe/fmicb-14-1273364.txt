Editorial on the Research Topic
Microbe-nanoparticle interactions: a mechanistic approach

The last decade has seen a tremendous growth in nanoparticles’ application as potential
antimicrobials against human, plant and animal diseases. The recent developments in
synthesis and use of metallic, magnetic, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, nanoemulsions
and nanogels have paved a path for their successful application against drug resistant
bacteria, fungi and viruses. The nanoparticles mediated drug-delivery systems and their
crucial role against quorum sensing and bioﬁlms have also been studied at a large scale.

Microbes including bacteria, fungi and viruses undergo a series of biochemical,
biophysical, physiological, molecular and metabolic changes during their interaction with
diﬀerent nanosystems. Nanoparticles employ a series of cellular and epigenetic changes
including generation of oxidative stress, DNA damage, changes in subcellular structure,
change in omics to degrade the microbial structure and serving as a potential antimicrobial
agent. However, some reports of microbes resistant against metal nanoparticles have also
been reported. The current Research Topic aimed to address the mechanistic insights into
the interaction of microbes-nanoparticles as potential antimicrobials and the strategies in
use to prevent the development of microbial resistant against nanoparticles systems. Within
this Research Topic, ﬁve articles including three research articles, one review and one mini-
review were published, which added to our knowledge on microbe-nanoparticle interaction.
The research article of Dhanya Raj et al. focused on the increasing drug resistance
patterns in uropathogens and role of emerging nano-therapeutics. They synthesized silver
nanoparticles using a brown-seaweed Turbinaria ornate. The obtained particles were
spherical in nature, with an average size of 73.98 nm. The synthesized particles showed a
high antioxidative and antibacterial activities. A good antibacterial activity was observed
against uropathogens,
including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The authors concluded that
silver nanoparticles can be developed as a new class of antimicrobial agents against urinary
tract infections.

Tiwari et al. worked on the development of “surface-tuned biocompatible nanomaterial-
containing formulations with selective antimicrobial activity.” They focused on
understanding the mechanism of polyethyleneimine-functionalized silver nanoparticles
(PEI-f-Ag-NPs) as an antifungal agent using the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of whole Candida
albicans cells as a molecular probe. PEI-f-Ag-NPs showed a low MIC value of 5 µg/mL, with

tendency with C. albicans surface and had a more selective
interaction with the tyrosine-rich proteins in the fungal cell.

Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, to confer a positive

for the synthesis of silver and copper nanoparticles. The results
indicated that CTAB stabilized silver and copper nanoparticles
were more eﬀective antibacterial agents against E. coli, S. aureus
and Sphingobacterium multivorum than PVP stabilized metal
nanoparticles. In conclusion, the authors speciﬁed the important
