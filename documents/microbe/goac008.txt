Abstract

Organismal survival depends on a well-balanced immune system and maintenance of host–microbe mutualism. The ﬁne-
tuned relationship between the gut microbiota and host immunity is constantly challenged by opportunistic bacteria
testing the integrity of gastrointestinal (GI) barrier defenses. Barrier dysfunction reduces immunological tolerance towards
otherwise innocuous microbes; it is a process that may instigate chronic inﬂammation. Paradoxically, sustained inﬂamma-
tion further diminishes barrier function, enabling bacterial translocation to extra-intestinal tissues. Once translocated,
these bacteria stimulate systemic inﬂammation, thereby compromising organ function. While genetic risk alleles associate
with barrier dysfunction, environmental stressors are key triggers of GI inﬂammation and associated breakdown in immune
tolerance towards resident gut microbes. As dietary components dictate substrate availability, they also orchestrate
microbiota composition and function, including migratory and pro-inﬂammatory potential, thus holding the capacity to
fuel both GI and extra-intestinal inﬂammation. Additionally, Western diet consumption may weaken barrier defenses via
curbed Paneth cell function and diminished host-defense peptide secretion. This review focuses on intervenable niches of
host–microbe interactions and mucosal immunity with the ambition to provide a framework of plausible strategies to
improve barrier function and regain tolerance in the inﬂamed mucosa via nutritional intervention.

host-defense peptides (HDPs) and immunoglobulin A (IgA)
make the duodenum, jejunum, and proximal ileum unfavorable
environments for bacterial growth [2]. Thus, relatively few bac-
teria can colonize these parts of the intestine, which are largely
dominated by facultative anaerobes and acid-tolerant bacteria
including Helicobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and
Lactobacillaceae [3–5]. Additionally, in these regions, most simple
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and other nutrients are digested
by host enzymes and absorbed. The environment of the distal
ileum is characterized by a pH value close to neutral, lower con-
centrations of antimicrobial molecules, and increased load of
dietary fibers, ultimately resulting in augmented microbial load
and diversity [2, 4] (Figure 1).

The colon harbors by far the highest density of microorgan-
isms due to a greatly reduced transit rate, low concentrations of
HDPs and oxygen, as well as a scarcity of simple carbon sources,
resulting in dense growth of anaerobic bacteria capable of fer-
menting complex dietary fibers. These microbes, primarily
Bacteroidaceae,
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
members
Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Clostridium, engage in prime
examples of host–microbe mutualism, where the host provides
a warm and nutrient-rich environment for the microbes to
thrive in, while the microbiota in turn carries the enzymes
needed for fiber fermentation and thereby aid in metabolizing
otherwise indigestible nutrients [2, 4, 5].

of

Besides alterations in microbial distribution along the length of
the gut, differences are also seen from the intestinal epithelial sur-
face through the mucus layer towards the lumen [6, 7]. Colonic
mucus is composed of an outer loose layer populated by bacteria
and an inner more compact layer largely devoid of bacteria. The
colonic outer mucus layer serves as a nutrient source for muco-
lytic bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila and certain mem-
bers of the Bacteroides, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria genera, while
the lumen is home to members of the Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae,
and Rikanellaceae families [4, 7]. Both mucus-associated and lumi-
nal bacteria interact with the host through diffusion of microbial-
produced metabolites or direct host immune interaction mediated
through sampling of microbe-associated molecular patterns
(MAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipid A, peptidoglycans,
flagella, and microbial nucleic acids. MAMPs are recognized by
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) and nuclear oligomerization domain-like receptors
expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and the underlying im-
mune cells of the lamina propria (LP). Tolerance towards luminal
antigens is mounted by several means such as homeostatic cross-
epithelial sampling by CX3CR1þ macrophages and subsequent de-
livery to migratory CD103þ dendritic cells (DCs) through gap junc-
tions, ultimately driving differentiation of regulatory T-cells
(Tregs) [8, 9]. The mucosal immune system further gauge micro-
bial activity via direct transfer across the epithelial barrier by small
intestinal Microfold-cells (M-cells) or Goblet cell-associated anti-
gen passages (GAPs) [10]. Additionally, IgA coating of luminal bac-
teria facilitates transport via the polymeric Ig receptor across the
epithelium. The near vicinity of the intestinal barrier to trillions of
microorganisms accentuates the intimate relationship between
host and microbe, and emphasizes the necessity for a well-
balanced immune system to ensure tolerance against friendly res-
idents while preserving proper immune reaction towards patho-
gens and opportunists [11, 12].

This review presents key aspects of host–microbe mutual-
ism, highlights its context dependency, and describes how the
mucosal
immune system orchestrates appropriate immune
responses towards gut microbes, be they mutualistic or patho-
genic, to sustain whole-body homeostasis. Finally, we discuss

promising strategies to rewire host–microbe interactions and
reinstate barrier function during GI inflammation.

Regionalized barrier defenses

The intestinal epithelium displays a high degree of heterogene-
ity tailored to meet the regionalized physiological requirements
[13, 14]. The epithelial lining additionally functions as a protec-
tive barrier separating the internal body from foreign encoun-
ters, including innocuous antigens derived from the diet and/or
the gut microbiota, as well as potentially harmful pathogens
utilizing the intestines as an entry site. Accordingly, barrier
defects compromise immunological tolerance facilitating exces-
sive immune activation towards the gut microbiota, thereby
fueling inflammation. To avoid this harmful trait, intestinal ho-
meostasis is maintained by specialized barrier protective cell
types. Paneth and goblet cells belong to the secretory epithelial
lineage responsible for HDP and mucus production, respec-
tively. In health, Paneth cells are restricted to the small intes-
tine and inversely associated with microbial loads based on
their HDP secretion [15], whereas the mucus-producing goblet
cells are quantitatively mirrored by microbial density [16]. This
trait is also reflected in regionalized mucus discrepancies be-
tween the small and large intestines (Figure 1). As such, the up-
per intestinal tract is covered by a single discontinuous mucus
layer, allowing nutrient uptake, whereas the mucus organiza-
tion in the colon is far denser. Additionally, colonic mucus con-
sists of both an inner layer impenetrable for the gut microbiota
under homeostatic conditions and an outer layer nurturing the
mucus-associated bacteria, while maintaining a healthy dis-
tance between host and microbes, and likewise protecting the
epithelium from mechanical damage imposed by passing stool
[14, 17]. Apart from mucus secretion, small intestinal goblet
cells partake in maintaining immune tolerance, in particular to-
wards dietary antigens, through GAPs, where luminal antigens
are passively sampled and delivered to the underlying migra-
tory CD103þ DCs in the LP [8, 10]. Moreover, a rare sentinel gob-
let cell subtype residing around the colonic crypt entrance
participates in barrier protection through TLR/MyD88-signaling
and NACHT, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain-containing 6
(NLRP6) inflammasome activation towards crypt intruders by
inducing compound exocytosis, thereby expelling potentially
infected goblet cells and mucus, shielding the crypts from mi-
crobial colonization and invasion in mice [18]. The relevance of
this mechanism is evident from NLRP6-knockout mice where
generational segregation nourishes an inflammatory-prone
microbiota, thus ultimately increasing the risk of intestinal in-
flammation and susceptibility to chemically induced colitis [19].
Subsequent studies did, however, point towards a certain de-
gree of redundancy in this barrier protective system, as lifetime
separation of littermate-controlled mice failed to develop a sim-
ilar phenotype in two geographically separated cohorts [20],
suggesting that multiple generations—and not maternal inheri-
tance per se—are needed to support the gradual development of
inflammation-prone microbes. As an added advantage to the
NLRP6-signaling, the mentioned sentinel goblet cells further
communicate through intercellular gap junctions to upper crypt
goblet cells promoting enhanced mucus production, thus bol-
stering barrier integrity [18].

mune tolerance of the intestinal environment to prevent

Figure 1. Host–microbe mutualism in the gastrointestinal tract. (A) Gastric ﬂuid emptying into the duodenum provides an acidic environment in the proximal small in-

testine. pH increases along the length until it reaches neutrality in the distal ileum. High concentrations of BAs and HDPs is mirrored by low microbial load in the prox-

imal small intestine. Dietary antigens, transit rate, BAs, and HDPs gradually decrease through the segments, thus inversely correlating with loads of indigestible ﬁbers
as well as microbial density and diversity. (B) MAMPs and metabolites are recognized by different IECs through distinct PRRs with altered expression patterns on the

basolateral and the apical surface of the IEC. Broadly, MAMPs can stimulate epithelial cytokine production, promote upregulation of TJs, increase mucus production,

epithelial fucosylation, HDP secretion, and maintenance of Paneth cell functions. The increased mucus production ensure that the mutualistic bacteria are conﬁned to

the mucosa, while simultaneously providing these mucolytic species with nutritional substrates for consumption. (C) HDPs protect the IECs by ensuring that the inner-
most layer of mucus closest to the epithelium is devoid of bacteria. (D) In mouse ileum, SFB penetrate the mucus layer and attach to the IECs. This attachment drives

epithelial cytokine production and downstream increased differentiation of Th17 cells important for barrier protection. (E) Host indigestible ﬁbers are fermented by co-

lonic microbes and generate host-beneﬁcial metabolites, such as SCFAs. SCFAs, along with other microbial metabolites, help strengthening the intestinal barrier

through several means; increased mucus production, promotion of IEC renewal, increased production of HDPs, upregulation of TJs, and promoting regulatory T-cell dif-
ferentiation. In addition, SCFAs contribute to the maintenance of whole-body homeostasis through regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Created with

chronic inflammation [16, 21]. This is orchestrated at the induc-
tive sites of the intestinal immune system and maintained at
the effector sites [22, 23]. The inductive sites comprise the mes-
enteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and gut-associated lymphoid tis-
sues (GALT), where the latter include Peyer’s patches, the cecal
patch, colonic patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, and imma-
ture cryptopatches (in the mouse) [24]. The different lymphoid
tissues of the gut perform specialized but overlapping functions
in relation to regulating tolerance vs immune activation [25].
While numerous checkpoints are in place to ensure well-
balanced immunity, a key effector arm relates to the substantial
amounts of transforming growth factor b (TGFb) produced by
the epithelium. TGFb imprints newly recruited monocytes from
the bloodstream to obtain an immune-suppressive phenotype
within the tissue, hallmarked by interleukin (IL)-10-responsive

macrophages [22, 23]. Supportive mononuclear phagocytes in-
clude conventional DC1 (cDC1) and cDC2, phenotypically de-
fined by expression of CD103þCD11b– and CD103–CD11bþ/
CD103þCD11bþ, respectively. cDC1 and cDC2 link the innate and
adaptive immune systems with discrete abilities to drive appro-
priate effector responses [26–28]. In the steady state, migratory
CD103þ DCs acquire antigen from the lumen and subsequently
upregulate C–C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) to facilitate
antigen-probed DC migration from the mucosa to the mLNs fol-
lowing gradients of chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19)
and CCL21 into the afferent lymphatics [29, 30]. Both these che-
mokines are expressed by lymphoid-tissue-associated stromal
cells [31] and secreted or transcytosed into the lumen of high
endothelial venules (HEVs)
[32, 33], whereas only CCL21 is
expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells [33]. Thus, CCL21

primarily guides the migrating DCs to the lymph nodes,
whereas both chemokines partake in guiding naive T-cells into
the lymphoid tissue through HEVs, increasing the likelihood of
T-cell recognition of cognate antigen [34]. CD103þ DCs are po-
tent inducers of Forkhead box P3þ (FoxP3þ) Tregs, as well as the
expression of gut-homing molecules (CCR9 and a4b7) through
their locally imprinted ability to produce retinoic acid (RA) [21,
35]. RA is derived from vitamin A metabolism, pointing towards
the modulating effect of diet on intestinal immune homeosta-
sis. This is further corroborated by a seminal report showing
that depletion of vitamin A in obese mice affects T-cell traffick-
ing, thereby aggravating obesity-induced barrier deficiencies,
gut-microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolic co-morbidities [36].

The mentioned tolerogenic immune traits are compromised
by barrier dysfunction, where gut-microbiota stimulation of
PRRs on DCs, epithelium, mesenchymal stromal cells, and other
local cell types induces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
and leukocyte recruitment, perpetuating a pro-inflammatory
response and ultimately compromises the immune-suppressive
state [23, 37]. Additionally, the inflammatory milieu promotes
expression of co-stimulatory molecules on cDCs, enabling them
to initiate an appropriately focused non-tolerogenic adaptive
immune response in the draining mLN [37]. Activated antigen-
specific effector T- and B-cells subsequently leave the mLN
through efferent lymphatics to the thoracic duct and circulate
back to the mucosa to exert their effects locally [38]. Conversely,
in the absence of barrier breach and inflammation, migrating
antigen-probed DCs would not express co-stimulatory mole-
cules and thereby not orchestrate an effector response. Instead,
interaction between migrating DCs and their cognate naive
T-cells would, combined with RA production and the TGFb-
enriched environment, lead to the induction of Foxp3 and gut-
homing molecules, increasing the amount of intestinal Tregs
[39], thus maintaining tolerance. Strategies to affect DC matura-
tion status and/or Treg induction may therefore be actively
exploited to regain tolerance in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Host–microbe communication at the mucosal
surface

Of further importance in maintaining and promoting tolerance
is the presence of innocuous microbes. Here, the gut microbiota
confers colonization resistance by limiting the growth of poten-
tial intruders via niche occupation, nutrient competition, and
bacteriocin secretion [4, 40]. Although certain species in the in-
terpersonal gut microbiota exhibit pathogenic potential under
aberrant circumstances and are thus referred to as pathobionts,
we coexist with most of our GI inhabitants in a mutually benefi-
cial relationship. Host–microbe mutualism can, among other
niches, be found at the intersection of the intestinal epithelium
and mucus layer. In both humans and rodents, some bacteria
such as Bifidobacterium and A. muciniphila can penetrate the mu-
cus layer and consume its constituents [7, 41], while other bac-
teria, such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), can
directly attach to the murine epithelial cell surface of the ileum
[42–44]. This interaction is essential

function of bona fide immune cells, IL-22 predominantly acts
on epithelial cells located at host–environment interfaces where
the target cells constitute a protective barrier as seen in the
skin, liver, kidneys, and respiratory and GI tracts [46, 47]. IL-22
has been shown to alleviate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced intesti-
nal epithelial cell stress in mice [48, 49], is important for Paneth
cell function and induction of HDP expression in different tis-
sues [47, 50–52], stimulates mucus production of murine and
human goblet cells [53–55], mediates epithelial barrier fortifica-
tion [45, 53], and at least in mice promotes intestinal epithelial
glycan fucosylation to facilitate the growth of mutualistic
mucus-associated species [56, 57]. Fucose can be used by muco-
lytic Bacteroides spp. and A. muciniphila as nutrient sources [58–
60]. In return, these bacteria generate short-chain fatty acid
(SCFA) metabolites [56, 61] exerting a wide range of beneficial
effects on host physiology and homeostasis, as reviewed in de-
tail elsewhere [62]. Interestingly, while A. muciniphila has re-
ceived much attention as a proposed probiotic [63], emerging
evidence also links this microbe to inflammatory-prone GI dis-
eases, including graft vs host disease [64], colitis [65], and small
intestinal injury [66], pointing towards context-dependent host–
microbe
apparent dichotomous host
responses to the same microbe also highlight why it might be
more advantageous to administer either lysed bacteria or bacte-
rial products, as effectively done with A. muciniphila [67, 68],

dum [70], all of which curb GI inflammation by microbe-specific

Shaping the gut microbiota

Diet

As briefly touched upon above, a prime example of host–mi-
crobe mutualism is the ability of gut microbes to metabolize in-
digestible dietary components such as complex fibers, for
which the host lacks the necessary metabolic enzymes. The
breakdown of fibers liberates carbon sources for the microor-
ganisms to feast on and provides the host with key metabolites
affecting pivotal processes of host physiology [62, 71, 72]. Diet
composition is therefore one of the most prominent determi-
nants of gut-microbiota composition and function. Disparate
diets exert distinct selection pressures due to variances in sub-
strates available for bacterial metabolism, ultimately selecting for
bacteria best capable of utilizing the particular diet [73]. Human
populations consuming a diet rich in fibers, such as the Hadza
hunter-gatherers from Tanzania or secluded Amerindians of
South America, have increased overall microbial diversity with
specific enrichment of Prevotella compared with consumers of a
Western diet (WD) that is low in fiber but high in proteins and fats
[74–76]. Enrichment of Prevotella, particularly Prevotella copri, is also
predictive for Western individuals responding favorably to a high-
fiber, barley-kernel-based diet
[77]. Paradoxically, numerous
reports additionally implicate P. copri in inflammatory and meta-
bolic disorders [78–80], e.g. by causally enhancing branch chain
amino acid (BCAA) transport over the gut epithelium, fueling
mouse and human insulin resistance [78], signifying opportunistic
behaviorism of this bacterium. Although potential strain differen-
ces cannot be excluded in the above-mentioned human studies
(for both A. muciniphila and P. copri), it is worth noting that the pre-
clinical mouse studies referred to were indeed conducted with
commercially available strains, matched between the diverging
reports. Observed dichotomy thus corroborates microbial plastic-
ity and presents a notable testimony of context dependency that

should be carefully considered when applying live microbes, such
as probiotic formulas, to human subjects [81]. Supporting this no-
tion, a fascinating proof-of-concept study of how diet and probiot-
ics affect the gut microbiota and clinical outcomes of melanoma
checkpoint-inhibitor immunotherapy convincingly demonstrated
that while high-fiber diet intake, known to diversify microbial
community structures, improved treatment efficacy, patients tak-
ing over-the-counter probiotics conversely exhibited significantly
poorer clinical outcomes than their none-probiotic-using counter-
parts [82].

The host-benefitted significance of bacterial breakdown of di-
etary components becomes evident considering that up to 10% of
the human daily energy requirement is provided by colonic fer-
mentation [83]. The major end-products of bacterial fermenta-
tion are SCFAs, in particular acetate, butyrate, and propionate,
exhibiting beneficial effects on host health and physiology [62]
including increased mucus production [84] and tight-junction as-
sembly [85] of human colonic epithelial cells, B-cell IgA class
switching through DC interactions in mice [86], and stimulating
HDP expression in mice and human intestinal epithelial cells
[87–89] as well as facilitating murine Treg generation through
epigenetic stabilization of Foxp3 [90–92]. When complex fibers are
scarce, typical SCFA producers adapt to ferment amino acids
that escaped digestion in the small intestine. This feature is
particularly pronounced during WD intake, where excess pro-
teins are metabolized by gut bacteria to BCAA and branched-
chain fatty acids (BCFA), associated with insulin resistance and
colonic inflammation [62, 78, 93, 94]. BCFA production is
protein-specific. Accordingly, changing the protein source from
casein to a protein mix resembling a typical WD for human con-
sumption altered the murine gut microbiota to enhance the
generation of BCFAs exacerbating diet-induced obesity and he-
patic insulin resistance through the mTORC1/S6K1 signaling
pathway [95]. Conversely, substituting the protein source in WDs
from casein to whole-cell lysates of the methanotrophic soil
bacterium, McB, reversed WD-induced pathogenic traits in mice
[69]. The McB diet normalized the composition and functional
landscape of the murine gut microbiota along with reduced fat
mass, enhanced colonic mucus production, and improved glu-
cose regulation, and promoted a consistent upregulation of
FoxP3þRORctþIL-17þ peripherally induced Tregs (described in
further detail in the dedicated section below) [69]. Similar to
changing the protein source, adding fermentable (inulin) but
not insoluble (cellulose) fibers to HFDs markedly restored intes-
tinal homeostasis in mice. In short, HFDs diminish both micro-
biota diversity
and density, which curbed enterocyte
proliferation and suppressed HDP secretion, thus enabling bac-
terial encroachment. Fiber enrichment ameliorated these traits
in a microbiota-dependent, yet SCFA-independent, manner.
Specifically, inulin-mediated microbiota-dependent restoration
of IL-22 expression facilitated enhanced HDP expression, pre-
venting microbiota encroachment and metabolic inflammation
[48]. Another hallmark example of diet–microbe–host interactions
relates to the intake of dietary emulsifiers—a frequently used ad-
ditive smoothing visual appearances. Dietary emulsifiers have
been shown to potentiate intestinal disturbances of both mice and
man, including increased risk of colitis and key features of meta-
bolic syndrome as well as intensifying the pro-inflammatory po-
tential of gut microbes. Emulsifier-mediated alterations in the
murine gut microbiota were both necessary and sufficient to drive
the above-mentioned pathologies [96]. These pioneering observa-
tions have recently been confirmed in a randomized human
controlled-feeding study [97], emphasizing that diet composition

powerfully influences the gut-microbiota composition and func-
tion, and thus the nature of host–microbe interactions.

HDPs

Aside from diet, the host itself has developed several mecha-
nisms to regulate the magnitude and composition of microor-
ganisms, populating its epithelial surfaces to maintain whole-
body homeostasis. The gut microbiota and host immune sys-
tem constantly crosstalk, where the host’s specific goal is to al-
low beneficial microorganisms to flourish yet confining them to
the external environment, i.e. the intestinal lumen and outer
mucus layer (Figure 1). HDPs, formerly known as antimicrobial
peptides, are one of the evolutionarily oldest representations of
innate immunity, found in essentially all branches of the phylo-
genetic tree of life [40, 98], and are central players in keeping the
gut microbiota at arm’s length. They are small cationic peptides,
typically <100 amino acids, and characterized by six highly con-
served cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds [99, 100].
In the gut, synthesis of HDPs is largely, but not exclusively, han-
dled by Paneth cells at the bottom of the small intestinal crypts
of Lieberku¨ hn. In humans, Paneth cells are responsible for the
production and secretion of human a-defensin 5 (HD5) and HD6,
lysozyme, group 2A phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A), and the
C-type lectin Regenerating islet-derived protein 3a (REG3a),
whereas other intestinal epithelial cells generally produce hu-
man b-defensin 1 (hBD1) and -2 (hBD2) [99, 101]. HDPs are
largely kept within the mucus layer due to electrostatic interac-
tions with mucin glycoconjugates, thus forming a decreasing
gradient outward with higher concentrations close to the intes-
tinal epithelium [101, 102]. This gradient protects against invad-
ing pathogens that are due to the resulting hostile environment
of the inner mucus layer, while being sufficiently diluted at the
outer mucus layer to maintain a symbiotic relationship with
mutualistic bacteria, underscoring the important role of HDPs
in controlling host–microbe interactions. While some HDPs,
such as REG3a [103] and lysozyme [104, 105], confer their bacte-
ricidal properties by disrupting bacterial membrane integrity,
others interfere with bacterial membrane synthesis [101] or
even self-assemble into large nanonets to capture and immobi-
lize microbes, as is the case with HD6 [106]. The host is generally
protected against the deadly properties of its own HDPs, due to
the cationic nature of HDPs, resulting in strong electrostatic
attractions towards the negatively charged bacterial membrane
and weak attractions towards the less negative eukaryotic host
cell [107, 108].

The crucial role of Paneth-cell-derived HDPs in keeping mu-
tualistic microbes in check and in regulating their composition
is corroborated by studies in transgenic mouse models with ab-
errant Paneth cell function. Here, the gut-microbiota composi-
tion, particularly the mucus-associated microbiota, was
significantly altered compared to wild-type mice [109–111].
Similarly, both genetic and diet-induced Paneth cell dysfunc-
tions promote increased inflammatory reactions towards mutu-
alistic bacteria, enhancing bacterial translocation and mucosal
inflammation [101, 109, 112, 113]. Further supporting the rele-
vance of HDPs in maintaining and even re-establishing homeo-
stasis, oral administration of fungal lysozyme enhances the
bacterial
lysis zone near the epithelium in HFD-fed mice,
thereby shielding the mucosal immune system from microbial
exposure [114]. Intriguingly, microbial lysis is not exclusively
beneficial and the phenotypic trait of mammalian lysozyme

6 | S.K. Jensen et al.

activity is vastly influenced by the inflammatory tone and ana-
tomical compartment. Thus, during relapsing inflammation, as
seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Paneth cells emerge
in the large intestine providing increased HDP production in
this compartment. Evolutionarily, such a mechanism is likely a
result of colonic mucus deterioration followed by microbial in-
vasion instigating a potent HDP response. Yet, as the microbial
community structure is fundamentally different in the colon
compared with the small intestine, lysozyme-mediated micro-
bial lysis in the former might potentiate inflammatory flares. A
prime example is Ruminococcus gnavus, a prominent member of
the colonic but not the small intestinal community and there-
fore not affected by small intestinal Paneth-cell-secreted lyso-
zyme in a steady state. However, during chronic inflammation,
ectopic Paneth cell formation in the lower intestine exposes
R. gnavus to endogenous lysozyme [115]. Rather than protecting
the host from microbial invasion akin to the role of lysozyme
in the small intestine [101], this context-dependent lysis of
R. gnavus liberates intracellular pro-inflammatory molecules,
thereby aggravating colonic disease activity [116]. This feature
may be circumvented by using fungal lysozyme belonging to
the glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 25 instead of the function-
ally distinct (GH22 family) mammalian lysozyme. Fungal lyso-
zyme appears capable of leveraging the gut microbiota to dose-
dependently alleviate experimental colitis. Diminished colitis
was followed by increased colonic R. gnavus abundances in two
genotypes, both sexes, and across three geographically and
inter-continent separated facilities, pointing towards a mark-
edly different microbiota imprinting ability of GH25 family lyso-
zymes compared to GH22 family lysozymes [114].

One may wonder how HDPs can be one of the evolutionarily
oldest and conserved systems of innate immunity yet remain
highly efficient with few known mechanisms of stable antimi-
crobial resistance, given the highly adaptive nature of microor-
ganisms [117, 118]. The answer may lie in the substantially
complex nature of HDPs. There are currently >2,600 known va-
rieties of HDPs [119] and this complexity can be further ex-
panded by HDP fragmentation [120–122]. A low redox potential
and naturally occurring redox enzymes create a reducing envi-
ronment in the gut, known to alter the tertiary structure of
HDPs by opening the disulfide bonds [123–125]. In contrast to
folded oxidized peptides, such linearized forms of HDPs can be
cleaved by naturally occurring proteases in the duodenal fluid
[126] or by bacterial proteases [127]. Cleavage of reduced HDPs
was previously believed to facilitate antimicrobial inactivation
[126, 127]. A novel biological concept was therefore fostered
when recent reports demonstrated how proteases present in
human duodenal fluid cleaved reduced hBD1 into an active an-
timicrobial octapeptide [122], as well as HD5, but not HD6, into
bioactive molecules with an antimicrobial repertoire exceeding
that of the full-length peptide [120]. Supporting these findings,
reduced human neutrophil peptide-4 (HNP-4) was similarly
shown to undergo proteolytic digestion by trypsin (found in
pancreatic secretions) into active antimicrobial peptide frag-
ments capable of combating multidrug-resistant bacteria [121].
HDP fragmentation may therefore represent an evolutionary re-
finement meant to fine-tune the gut-microbiota composition in
a changing environment.

Rewiring gastrointestinal immunity by HDPs

Accumulating evidence further repositions HDPs as prominent
immune regulators [128] both within [129] and outside [130–132]
the GI tract. A recent study by Liang and colleagues [133]

elegantly demonstrated that non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice
exhibited diminished abundances of the HDP, cathelicidin-
related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), associating with gut-
microbiota dysbiosis. Intracolonic supplementation of CRAMP
rescued colonic microbiota and immune alterations in NOD
mice, thereby protecting against pancreatic autoimmunity-
related diabetes [133]. While the complexity and versatile mode
of action of these fascinating peptides remains under intense
investigation, much of the current research points towards al-
tered immune chemotaxis. As an example, hBD2 has repeatedly
been shown to interact with chemokine receptors CCR2 [134]
and CCR6 [135], thereby impacting immune cell trafficking.
Direct binding to CCR2 on in vitro generated DCs further curbed
TLR-mediated inflammation and lowered the expression of co-
stimulatory molecules on responding DCs [129], suggesting that
hBD2 may be used as a novel biological tool to curb DC-primed
T-cell activation; it could potentially be exploited to re-establish
tolerance in GI disorders. Another testimony to this potential
relates to the observation that CCR2 enhances CD25 expression
on FoxP3þ Tregs, increasing their abundance in mice indepen-
dently of chemotaxis and CCR2þ myeloid cells (including DCs)
[136]. It is therefore worth speculating that CCR2 agonists, such
as hBD2, would be able to promote Treg generation or mainte-
nance by elevated CD25 expression in FoxP3þ T-cells and simul-
taneously lower the number of effector T-cells (via diminished
expression of co-stimulatory molecules on migrating DCs), col-
lectively favoring tolerogenic immunity.

Instead of competing with endogenous ligands, it was re-
cently shown that a short linear, basic peptide (proteolytically
cleaved CCL21, termed C21TP) interacts directly with the N-ter-
minus of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and substantially
increases the potency of the two endogenous ligands, CCL19
and CCL21 [137]. Considering the structure of these peptides, it
is reasonable to think that short alkaline peptides shield the
electrostatic charges of CCR7, allowing enhanced docking of
their agonists. To corroborate this hypothesis and considering
the structural similarity between C21TP and hBD2, in line with
the fact that most endogenous HDPs become linearized in a re-
duced environment as mentioned above, we assessed whether
the presence or absence of linearized hBD2 would alter the che-
motactic activity of CCL19 and/or CCL21 against the DC-
expressed chemokine receptor, CCR7. Indeed, while C21TP uni-
formly boosts CCL19 and CCL21 potency,
linearized hBD2
appeared to exclusively enhance CCL19-mediated chemotaxis
(Figure 2). Combined, these data suggest that linearized alkaline
peptides may regulate chemotaxis and migratory pace, adding
yet another piece to the puzzle on how HDPs may orchestrate
GI immunity.

HDPs and barrier dysfunction in
gastrointestinal inflammation

As pointed out above, the maintenance of host–microbe mutu-
alism is essential for upholding whole-body homeostasis. An
unbalanced relationship may increase contact between the host
and its microbial inhabitants, enhancing the risk of bacterial
translocation and susceptibility to inflammatory GI diseases.
This is supported by mounting evidence linking susceptibility
genes of IBD, a general umbrella term for ileal and colonic
Crohn’s diseases (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), that encode
proteins involved in maintaining a healthy epithelial barrier
function and host-defense responses towards its microbiota [12,
138, 139]. The first genetic links associated with CD were those

Figure 2. hBD2 treatment curbs gastrointestinal inﬂammation. (A) In steady state, the intestinal microbiota is highly diverse and largely kept in the lumen. The small

intestinal crypts of Lieberku¨ hn are kept sterile by the high concentrations of locally secreted HDPs by crypt-resident Paneth cells. Luminal antigens are sampled
through several means; local CX3CR1þ macrophages send extensions into the mucus and lumen to sample microbes. Subsequently, sampled antigens are delivered to
CD103þ DCs, which migrate to the mLNs to present antigen to naive T-cells. In the absence of danger signals, such interaction induces the differentiation of cognate
T-cells to gut-homing Tregs. Similarly, antigens transported through M-cells in the follicle-associated epithelium covering Peyer’s patches is taken up by local underly-

ing DCs. The DCs subsequently migrate into the T-cell zone of Peyer’s patches and induce differentiation of T-cells to Tregs in a similar manner as in mLNs. (B) During

severe gastrointestinal inﬂammation, as seen in IBD or infectious diseases, the microbial diversity drops drastically and is largely dominated by opportunistic and
pathogenic species. Paneth cell dysfunction, as can be seen in both Crohn’s disease and during HFD feeding, reduced tight-junction expression and deterioration of the

mucus layer further impairs barrier integrity. Together, this allows encroachment of bacteria and increases the risk for bacterial translocation. The inﬂammatory envi-

ronment with increased microbial-derived antigens and thus PRR stimulation induces the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production of DCs, ren-

dering them able to induce non-regulatory effector T-cells. (C) Administration of physiologically relevant amounts of exogenous hBD2 partially restores barrier
function by promoting epithelial fortiﬁcation, thereby lowering the inﬂammatory burden and ultimately restoring microbial diversity. Due to the low redox environ-

ment of the gut, which is exacerbated during inﬂammation owing to increased generation of nitrate and reactive oxygen species (ROS), HDPs are reduced and cleaved

into novel antimicrobial fragments, expanding the antimicrobial repertoire. HDP—thereby also hBD2—linearization may further affect their potential to boost chemo-

kine signaling (Panel D). Additionally, folded hBD2 have been shown to act through CCR2 and CCR6, expressed on DCs, thus facilitating chemotaxis and further partake
in immune regulation. Finally, CCR2 stimulation of FoxP3þ Tregs boosts Treg abundances via CD25 upregulation, lending credence to the hypothesis that alternative
CCR2 ligands, such as exogenously administered hBD2, can be used to as a therapeutic tool to regain tolerance. (D) Linearized hBD2 selectively enhances the activity of

CCL19 over CCL21, both acting through the chemokine receptor CCR7, thereby precision editing immune chemotaxis. Experimentally, we measured CCR7 activity
through Gai as the ability to inhibit a forskolin-induced increase in intracellular cAMP. CHO cells transfected with a CCR7 plasmid and the cAMP BRET sensor CAMYEL
were stimulated with various concentrations of chemokines in the presence of C21TP, hBD2 (both 10mM), or phosphate buffered saline. C21TP is a C-terminal fragment
of CCL21 that boosts the activity of both CCL19 and CCL21 through CCR7 [135]. hBD2 selectively boosts CCL19, not CCL21, signaling virtually identical to C21TP. Created

of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) re-
ceptor [140, 141], an intracellular PRR recognizing bacterial pep-
tidoglycans [141]. NOD2 is expressed by both human and
murine Paneth cells and plays a crucial role in regulating gut-
microbiota composition by controlling the expression and se-
cretion of HDPs [111, 142, 143]. NOD2 gene variants remain the
strongest known risk factors for development of ileal CD [140,
141], supporting that impaired Paneth cell function and HDP
production are highly implicated in at least small intestinal CD
pathology [144]. These observations indicate a pivotal role for
Paneth cells and their HDPs in intestinal health and that the col-
lapse of host defenses, and thus host–microbe mutualism, plays
an important role in GI inflammatory disorders. This is addi-
tionally supported by observations that loss-of-function muta-
tions in the autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) protein,
another CD-associated risk gene, result in impaired exocytosis
of secretory granules in Paneth cells [145] and dysregulate IL-22
signaling, resulting in aggravated inflammatory responses and
necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells in mice [146].

Although dysbiosis appears to be an integrated, and often
necessary, part of GI inflammation, it remains debated whether
gut dysbiosis is causally implicated in these multifactorial pa-
thologies. Transfer of microbiota from human CD and UC
patients to germ-free mice reduced abundances of RORctþ Tregs
compared with transfer from healthy controls [147], demon-
strating that inflammatory proficient microbes affect host im-
munity. Still, immunological rewiring depended on the genetic
susceptibility of the epithelial barrier dysfunction to precipitate
spontaneous inflammation [147], pointing towards barrier
defects as a primary cause of IBD. Along these lines, gut bacteria
have been shown to translocate from the intestinal barrier into
mLNs, blood, and adipose tissues following induced colitis and
ileitis [148, 149]. Creeping fat is characterized by the migration
and subsequent accumulation of mesenteric adipocytes cluster-
ing around inflamed and fibrotic intestinal tissues observed in
patients with ileal CD [150] and is suggested to occur as a re-
sponse to gut-barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation
[151], possibly serving as a protective mechanism deployed to
limit the systemic distribution of potentially harmful microbes
and associated molecules. This is further supported by a recent
study demonstrating that bacteria isolated from creeping fat in
patients with CD were able to translocate to mesenteric adipose
tissue. Additionally, these bacteria were able to exacerbate coli-
tis upon transfer to antibiotic-treated mice [152], thus lending
credence to the hypothesis of creeping fat being a defense
mechanism confining invading bacteria, thereby limiting sys-
temic dissemination.

Bacterial translocation as a function of
diet-induced barrier defects

Bacterial translocation not only occurs in classical IBDs, but
also in obesity [153, 154], fatty liver disease [155, 156], and
other metabolic conditions characterized by a leaky gut [11,
157, 158]. It remains debated whether gut leakiness is primarily
microbiota-, diet-, or disease-mediated. While gut microbes
can both translocate and promote barrier breach, these are—to
the best of our knowledge—often secondary hits caused by
physiological disturbances, as exemplified above with dietary
emulsifiers facilitating microbiota invasion [159]. Diet compo-
sition may also alter the intestinal landscape compromising
host defenses. Murine WD feeding induces Paneth cell defects

[112] associated with lower HDP secretion. Conversely, thera-
peutic treatment with physiologically relevant levels of the
hallmark human Paneth cell HDPs, particularly HD5, mitigated
insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in diet-induced obese
mice [160], highlighting the importance of intact host-defense
mechanisms in maintaining organismal homeostasis. Obesity
and WD consumption predispose to hyperglycemia—a condi-
tion that independently drives barrier dysfunction, thereby en-
hancing colitis susceptibility and risk of enteric infections
through transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial
cells and tight-junction integrity [161]. Although leaky gut is
associated with chronic low-grade inflammation often seen in
individuals with metabolic diseases [162], reports of microbial
signatures in extra-intestinal tissues have often been discred-
ited as a result of environmental contamination. Challenging
the previous dogma of sterile internal organs, multiple recent
studies have used strict contamination-aware approaches to
substantiate that bacteria and/or bacterial products can indeed
be found in our internal organs during disease [153, 154] and
even postprandial in healthy young men [155]. Corroborating
biological relevance and not merely a tale of wishful thinking,
bacterial abundance followed the expected anatomical route
and the composition discriminated between disease states
[154]. Predominantly members of the opportunistic phylum
Proteobacteria can be found in adipose tissues [153, 154] and liv-
ers [154] of individuals with morbid obesity and type 2 diabe-
tes. Mechanistically, microbiota-derived products from an
impaired gut barrier can be transported to distal tissues by gut
microbial DNA-containing extracellular vesicles (mEVs) [163].
Extracellular vesicles are normally filtered by liver CRIgþ mac-
rophages and the adoptive transfer of mEVs to CRIg–/– mice po-
tentiated microbial-derived product transport to distal tissues
contributing to obesity-associated tissue inflammation and in-
sulin resistance [163]. As macrophage function is generally
hampered by obesity [164] and because insulin resistance pro-
motes hyperglycemia, it is foreseeable that this condition pro-
vides the perfect storm for initial barrier breach followed by
bacterial and/or bacterial product translocation. In support,
Cani and colleagues [165] originally defined metabolic endo-
toxemia as unusual levels of circulating bacterial endotoxins,
in particular LPS, fueling obesity and insulin resistance, thus
initiating a vicious immunometabolic cycle from the gut to ex-
tra-intestinal tissues. Elevated levels of LPS can be detected in
the plasma of humans showing features of metabolic syn-
drome, including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and
chronic low-grade inflammation [166], which is exacerbated
upon high fat intake [167]. Still, as LPS is a complex molecule
found in different acetylation forms affecting molecular struc-
ture [168] and thereby binding capacity, not all types of LPS are
metabolically detrimental to the host. Comparing the meta-
bolic effects of Escherichia coli-derived and Rhodobacter sphaer-
oides-derived LPS, it was recently demonstrated that only E. coli
LPS mediated intestinal barrier disruption, dysglycemia, and
low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue [169]. Interestingly,
rather than being a biologically neutral LPS form, R. sphaeroides
LPS counteracted E. coli LPS-induced metabolic dysregulations
and improved glucose metabolism in obese mice [169]. This
study is therefore an elegant demonstration of the incredible
context-dependent nature of host–microbe interactions and a
testimony to the importance of distinguishing between LPS
composition and characteristics when discussing metabolic
endotoxemia.

Rewiring gastrointestinal immunity by
nutritional imprinting

As barrier defects promote unwarranted immunity towards
otherwise mutualistic and thus harmless microbes, it is key to
understand how we can regain immunological tolerance, to-
wards the gut microbiota, but equally importantly toward die-
tary antigens. Here, acquired immunity, and most notably
Tregs, is of immense importance. Two major types of FoxP3þ
thymic-derived FoxP3þRORct–Heliosþ
Tregs exist: natural
(nTregs) and peripherally induced FoxP3þRORct–Helios– and
FoxP3þRORctþHelios– (iTregs) [170]. FoxP3þRORctþ iTregs are
microbially induced, primarily in the large intestine, and have
been shown to exhibit superior immune-suppressive capacity
compared with anTregs, and are therefore essential for pe-
ripheral immune homeostasis [171, 172]. A key factor in pe-
ripheral induction of iTregs is RA stimulation upon antigen
recognition by migratory CD103þ DCs in GALT and mLN [39].
During this process, other environmental factors might addi-
tionally enhance the induced FoxP3 phenotype, such as micro-
bial bile acid metabolites [173], SCFAs [92], MyD88-signaling

[174], TGFb [39], and supportive cytokines [175–177]. While
nTregs dominate the small intestinal LP, a compartment char-
acterized by low microbial loads, FoxP3þRORctþ iTregs are
more abundant in LP of the more densely microbially popu-
lated large intestine [171]. Interestingly, tolerance was recently
shown to anatomically compartmentalize, as proximal murine
mLNs provided a superior tolerogenic environment compared
with more distal mLNs (ileal and colonic), potentially as a con-
sequence of the larger RA production in the upper small intes-
tine due to higher exposure to diet-derived vitamin A [178].
This elegantly demonstrates alternative ways of compartmen-
talizing and maintaining intestinal tolerance in diverse intes-
tinal environments, where proximal draining mLNs are
generally associated with tolerance induction towards dietary
antigens and distally draining mLNs towards the microbiota,
albeit with a skewing towards easier induction of inflamma-
tion in the latter [176, 178]. Instant transition between tolero-
genic
immunity and inflammation may represent an
evolutionary conserved trait installed to empower the host to
swiftly mount a protective immune response upon barrier dis-
ruption in the more densely populated lower intestine.

10 | S.K. Jensen et al.

Specific bacterial components can induce tolerogenic
responses and mitigate metabolic and GI diseases. This notion
is supported by findings showing that colonic, but not small in-
testinal, FoxP3þRORctþ iTregs can be effectively induced by cell
surface polysaccharides of B. bifidum via TLR2-expressing DCs
[70]. Likewise, both lysed A. muciniphila and a purified cell-wall
component of the bacterium can mitigate metabolic dysregula-
tion, reduce fat mass, and improve dyslipidemia in mice more
potently than the live bacterium [67]. Additionally, supplemen-
tation of lysed A. muciniphila in human subjects improved insu-
lin sensitivity and reduced total plasma cholesterol and fat
mass compared with placebo controls in a randomized, double-
blinded human study [68], thus suggesting that microbial com-
ponents rather than live microbes can be exploited as novel
tools to curb microbial dysbiosis associated with metabolic and
inflammatory GI disorders. In agreement with both this notion
and the previous studies mentioned above, bacterial lysates of
McB used as a protein source in a high-fat/high-sugar WD in-
creased the FoxP3þRORctþ iTreg pool in both murine small and
large intestines [69]. To the best of our knowledge, McB feeding
represents a unique dietary intervention to promote small in-
testinal FoxP3þRORctþ iTreg induction and thus holds great po-
tential as a therapeutic strategy targeting small
intestinal
diseases, including ileal CD and food allergies. A large fraction
of these FoxP3þRORctþ iTregs additionally exhibited increased
IL-17 production in the large intestine compared with non-McB-
supplemented WD and low-fat diet (LFD)-fed mice; it is a trait
that tended to persist in the small intestine [69]. The involve-
ment and importance of Tregs to maintain intestinal immune
homeostasis and the apparent importance of IL-17 in maintain-
ing a healthy microbiota and proper barrier defense could spur
the idea that augmented IL-17-producing FoxP3þRORctþ iTregs
represent a safe path to enhanced IL-17 production without ad-
ditionally increasing the risk of Th17-mediated inflammation-
associated pathology. Induction of FoxP3þRORytþ Tregs in the
setting of McB feeding was further associated with a remarkable
change in the gut microbiota towards that of LFD-fed reference
mice, despite the McB-fed mice being maintained on a high-fat/
high-sugar WD [69]. Although most changes reflected those ob-
served in LFD-fed mice, two genera appeared to be unequally af-
fected, namely a notable increase in Parabacteroides mirrored by
an equally dramatic decrease in Desulfovibrio. A reciprocal rela-
tionship was seen in WD-fed mice (standard protein source).
WD-McB-induced Parabacteroides bloom depended on adaptive
immunity. Accordingly, Rag–/– mice exhibited negligible and
uniform loads of
Interestingly,
Parabacteroides distasonis both alleviates obesity and metabolic
dysfunction [179] as well as chemically induced inflammation
[180], akin to the effects of McB feeding [69, 181]. Conversely,
Desulfovibrio is often increased in human colitis [182]. It pro-
motes obesity in mice following T-cell impairments [183] and
disrupts barrier function via sulfate-reducing activities [184],
thereby degrading health promoting sulfomucins [185]. The
sulfate-reducing activities are further proposed to be directly in-
volved in the pathogenesis of UC by hydrogen sulfide formation
[186]. WD-McB feeding significantly abrogated these traits
(Figure 3).

disorders is steadily increasing, hence representing a signifi-
cant—and escalating—challenge to healthcare systems, and
negatively impacting life quality across socioeconomic statuses.
Novel therapies targeting barrier defects are thus urgently
needed. While oral administration of live microorganisms holds
the potential for re-establishing GI homeostasis when being tai-
lored to specific dietary regimens, they also come with a risk of
potential side effects in subjects either not adhering to provided
dietary guidelines or with increased susceptibility to specific
diseases and/or microbiota-dependent treatment modalities.
An alternative and more controllable path forward may there-
fore lay in the use of microbially derived products and/or natu-
rally occurring HDPs being tailored to regain tolerance.
However, as the barrier defect must be repaired to maintain tol-
erogenic immunity, we still need innovative strategies to iden-
tify intestinotrophic drug candidates. Lastly, therapies aiming
at unarming opportunistic bacteria via precision editing of the
gut microbiota may be of particular interest enabling the main-
tenance of mutualistic microbes while exclusively targeting po-
tential invaders, thereby mitigating bacterial translocation.
