Abstract

Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the development of granulomas in various organs,
especially in the lungs and lymph nodes. Clinics of the disease largely depends on the organ involved and may
range from mild symptoms to life threatening manifestations. Over the last two decades, significant advances in the
diagnosis, clinical assessment and treatment of sarcoidosis have been achieved, however, the precise etiology of
this disease remains unknown. Current evidence suggests that, in genetically predisposed individuals, an excessive
for the development of sarcoidosis. Epidemiological and
immune response to unknown antigen/s is crucial
microbiological studies suggest that, at least in a fraction of patients, microbes or their products may trigger the
immune response leading to sarcoid granuloma formation. In this article, we discuss the scientific evidence on the
interaction of microbes with immune cells that may be implicated in the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis, and
highlight recent studies exploring potential implications of human microbiota in the pathogenesis and the clinical
course of sarcoidosis.

Background
Sarcoidosis is a unique inflammatory disease characterized
by the formation of non-caseating granulomas that can
affect any body organ but most often affects the lungs and
liver,
lymph nodes and less commonly the skin, eyes,
heart, and brain [3, 44]. Extensive research over the last 20
years has contributed to improve the diagnosis and man-
agement of this disease. However, despite important ad-
vances in the understanding of the inflammatory process
associated with sarcoidosis, its etiology still remains un-
known. The fact that sarcoidosis can mimic many auto-
immune disorders and/or may coexist with them, together
with the amelioration of symptoms in response to cortico-
steroids or immunosuppressive drugs, support the notion
that an autoimmune reaction is a critical component on
the pathogenesis of this disease [3, 11, 159].

In addition, the existence of cases of familial sarcoidosis
along with the observations that certain HLA loci and

genes are associated with increased risk of sarcoidosis sug-
gest that a genetic predisposition also plays a role in dis-
ease pathogenesis [25, 60]. In addition, accumulating
evidence indicate that certain microorganisms, especially
Cutibacterium acne (C. acne) (previously known as propi-
onibacterium acne) and mycobacterium tuberculosis
(mTB) may be implicated in the development of sarcoid-
osis, and thus various authors have proposed the possibil-
ity of
the standard
treatment of this disease [7, 12, 19]. Moreover, given the
structural similarities of certain mycobacterial proteins,
especially heat shock proteins of mycobacterium tubercu-
losis (mTB-hsp) with human heat shock proteins (HSPs),
it has been proposed that the exposure to mycobacterial
antigens, via either natural infection, or by vaccination
with BCG, may trigger an autoimmune response leading
to sarcoidosis, in genetically prone individuals [36].

or not, there is a link between specific alterations in the
composition of certain microbiota niches (namely dysbio-
sis of the gut or dysbiosis of the lung microbiota) and the
development or progression of sarcoidosis.

In this article, we revise the scientific evidence on the
potential role that host/microbe interplay may have in
the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. The clinical relevance of
previous reports and ongoing clinical trials testing the
therapeutic utility of antimicrobials for the management
of this disease is also highlighted.

Main text
Epidemiology of sarcoidosis
The incidence rate of sarcoidosis varies depending on
the geographic region. For example, high incidence rates
are reported in Northern European countries, such as
Sweden and Iceland, with nearly 60 cases per 100,000
population [44]. In Asians, the incidence rate is lower,
being 1.3 and 2.17 per 100,000 in Japan and Taiwan re-
spectively [131, 159]. In the United States, high inci-
dence in Afro-Americans has been reported (35.5 per
100,000), which contrasts with a lower incidence (10.9
per 100,000) in their Caucasian counterparts [3, 119].
Interestingly, relatively high incidence rates (16.9 per
100,000 per year) have also been documented in African
descendants living in certain European countries [45],
however, a study examining the occurrence of sarcoid-
osis in African descendants living in the Caribbeans, re-
incidence (2.3 per 100,000).
ported a much lower
Although such a lower incidence rate observed in Afro
Caribbeans could be due to the most rigorous inclusion
criteria utilized in that study, which required a positive
biopsy to consider a case to be positive [23], the lower
incidence in the Afro Caribbeans may indeed indicate
that geographic and environmental factors are also im-
plicated in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Sarcoidosis more commonly occurs in people younger
than 40, with a peak in the age-group from 25 to 40
years, but the disease has been diagnosed in people of all
ages [3]. Intriguingly, the occurrence of this disease in
seasonal clustering has been observed in certain regions
of the world. For example, in Japan most cases are diag-
nosed during June and July. In Spain, half of the cases
occur between April and June, and about 70% of cases
confirmed in Greece occur between March and May and
lower incidence of the disease during the autumn was
reported in specific population of
the United States
[152]. These apparent “seasonal sarcoidosis” could be re-
lated to specific seasonal changes in weather, however
the seasonal pattern of certain infectious diseases occur-
rence also points on the possibility that infection with
certain microbes may be implicated [57].

the disease is more likely to be a chronic and severe dis-
order involving several organs that can lead to death
[102]. Erythema nodosum (an acute, nodular, erythema-
tous eruption that usually is limited to the extensor as-
pects of the lower legs) occurs frequently in young female
Caucasians, especially from Scandinavian countries [44]
and Löfgren syndrome (an acute form of sarcoidosis char-
acterized by erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymph-
adenopathy, and polyarthralgia or polyarthritis) is more
likely to occur in Scandinavians and in patients from
Spain [100]. On the other hand, sarcoidosis with ocular in-
volvement and cardiac features is more likely to occur in
Japanese individuals [44].

Clinics of sarcoidosis
Since sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease,
symptoms largely depend on the organs affected [12]
(Table 1). Strikingly, between 30 to 60% of individuals af-
fected are entirely asymptomatic and the disease is discov-
checkups.
chance during routine medical
ered by
Symptoms, when occur, tend to be non-specific and may
include fatigue, anorexia, lack of energy and arthralgia that
may mimic a variety of conditions such as malignancies,
autoimmune disorders or chronic infections [16, 20, 100].
Pulmonary involvement, which is the most frequent
form of the disease, may present with cough and short-
ness of breath and less commonly hemoptysis [15, 84].
The second most commonly affected organ is the skin
and may present with variable rash, papules or with the
typical bump nodules of erythema nodosum [9, 67]. In
individuals with eye involvement, symptoms may include
dry eyes, blurry vision and red eye [67].

Except for Japanese individuals, in whom cardiac sar-
coidosis is a common manifestation of this disease, heart
affectation has been considered a rare phenomenon [73].
However, recent publications suggest that cardiac sar-
coidosis is more common than previously reported with
most patients unaware of its presence [86]. Clinically, car-
diac sarcoidosis may present with severe dysrhythmias,
such as tachycardia or heart block, both of which can be
fatal [63, 161]. Less commonly, patients with cardiac sar-
coidosis present pericardial effusion or other structural le-
sions such as granuloma formation and fibrosis, leading to
mechanical dysfunction of the heart [63].

Furthermore, sarcoidosis can cause a wide variety of
musculoskeletal complaints affecting the bones, joints, or
muscles with joint involvement manifested as acute or
chronic arthritis [109, 137]. Curiously, in Japanese individ-
uals, enlargement of spleen has also reported in a consid-
erable number of patients with sarcoidosis, which was
linked to a specific genetic background [129].

Disease severity and clinical manifestations also show
certain racial patterns. For instance, in African Americans

Finally, Sarcoidosis affecting the nervous system (neuro-
sarcoidosis) is a rare condition that can manifest as a

Findings in conventional Chest X-rays may be the first

such as high resolution CT scan (HRCT) and magnetic
resonance (MRI) imaging.

tomography

In addition, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography–computed
(FDG-PET/CT)
scan has become an extremely useful technique not only
for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis but also for evaluating
treatment response [62, 84, 100], however the high cost
of FDG-PET/CT scan is an important limitation for its
utilization as a standard approach for monitoring patient
response to therapy.

In patients with lung involvement, pulmonary function
tests are useful to assess lung functioning and bronchos-
copy for bronchial inspection and biopsy extraction are
frequently utilized. The development of ultrasound im-
aging coupled with bronchoscopy has improved the
diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis as it increases the
yield of tissue aspiration of hilar and/or mediastinal
lymph nodes [84].

According to the inclusion criteria from the American
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/World
Association of Sarcoidosis and other Granulomatous
Disorders (ATS/ERS/WASOG), there are three criteria
for diagnosis sarcoidosis: (1) a compatible clinical and
radiologic presentation, (2) pathologic evidence of typ-
ical lesions in more than one organ, and (3) exclusion of
other diseases known to cause granulomatous disease.
However, since the clinical presentation of sarcoidosis is
quite variable and there is not a single diagnostic test or
procedure to definitely diagnosis sarcoidosis,
in many
cases the diagnosis of this disease is challenging [74]. Re-
cently, Bickett et al. reported the development of quanti-
tative diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis. This approach
combines biopsy findings in granulomas (SDS biopsy
score) and clinical
features (SDS clinical score). Al-
though this study included patients from a single center,
the SDS score performed well (specificity of > 95%) as a
diagnostic test for sarcoidosis [14], and thus this score
may be a “first step in making the diagnosis of sarcoid-
osis significantly less arbitrary”[84]. Further analyses,
ideally conducted across several institutions are required
to determine the diagnostic utility of this score.

A recently study that included 2163 Caucasian patients
with sarcoidosis who were evaluated at 31 study centers in
Europe, revealed that patients with acute onset were mainly
female, young and presented with scadding type I or II.
High frequency of eye and skin involvement along with fa-
tigue were also frequently observed in female patients.
More importantly, according to the predominant organs af-
fected, patients could be consistently stratified into five

Inaoka et al. Journal of Biomedical Science           (2019) 26:45

distinct subgroups: 1) abdominal organ involvement, 2)
ocular–cardiac–cutaneous–central nervous system disease
involvement, 3) musculoskeletal–cutaneous involvement,
4) pulmonary and intrathoracic lymph node involvement,
and 5) extrapulmonary involvement [135]. In addition to its
utility for stratifying homogenous and well-defined sub-
groups of sarcoidosis patients, these findings are very useful
to direct new studies aimed to identify potential links be-
tween specific genotypes with disease phenotypes. This is
particularly important considering that a genetic predispos-
ition appears to play important roles in the development
and clinical course of sarcoidosis.

Treatment recommendations for patients with sarcoid-
osis will not be reviewed in this article, however, it is im-
portant
to mention that since spontaneous resolution
frequently occurs, many patients with pulmonary disease
do not require any specific treatment and can be monitored
over a period of time [10]. In those requiring treatment,
oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone, re-
main the first line therapy in both, acute and chronic sar-
coidosis and in most cases the disease is very responsive,
however, there are no standard protocols for corticosteroid
dose or duration of treatment and long-term exposure to
these agents is associated with substantial morbidity [83].

In patients who do not respond to corticosteroids,
more potent immunosuppressant drugs such as metho-
trexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate may be re-
quired, although due to the considerable secondary
effects associated with the long-term use of these drugs,
patients need to be carefully monitored [10, 126].

In addition, biological agents,

including anti-TNF-α
monoclonal antibodies (infliximab) and anti-CD20 mono-
clonal antibodies (rituximab) have shown promising thera-
peutic potential in select group of patients, especially in
those with severe or refractory sarcoidosis, [1, 83, 126].

Recently the Innate Repair Receptor (IRR) activator
ARA 290, has been designed an orphan drug for the
treatment of sarcoidosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) and the European Union and was
granted as Fast Track designation by the FDA for the
treatment of painful small fiber neuropathy in patients
with sarcoidosis. ARA290 has been evaluated in patients
with small fiber neuropathy associated with sarcoidosis
or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the sarcoidosis group,
ARA290 improved quality of life and significantly ame-
liorated neuropathic and autonomic symptoms and thus
ARA290 will be useful for ameliorating pain associated
with this form of sarcoidosis [28, 155].

Pathogenesis of sarcoidosis: the autoimmune theory
As mentioned above, the key pathogenic component of
sarcoidosis is the development of noncaseating granu-
lomas that can arise in different organs. Current evidence
suggests that a combination of genetic predisposition and

environmental conditions play a central role in the exces-
sive immune reaction leading to the development of sar-
coidosis [54, 125]. Granulomas constitute an excessive
immune response aimed to control or eliminate an unchar-
acterized antigen. Proposed candidate antigens include vari-
ous microorganisms or their products, inorganic particulate
matters, metal particles or unknown environmental contam-
inants and due to the predominance of lung involvement,
antigens are believed to enter the body via the respiratory
system within airdrops or microparticles [35, 91].

Histologically, sarcoidal granulomas are character-
ized by the presence of centrally organized collections
of epithelioid histiocytes and macrophages surrounded
by giant cells and lymphocytes, mostly Th1 lympho-
cytes, and a rim of fibrosis [21, 91]. Unlike infectious
granulomas, such as those associated with mTB,
in
sarcoidal granulomas, necrosis is uncommonly seen,
which defines its non-caseating nature [21, 147]. Al-
though not specific to sarcoidosis, Schaumann bodies
(within the cytoplasm of multinucleated cells) and as-
teroid bodies (star shaped cytoplasmic inclusions) are
frequently seen [122].

The immune signature of sarcoidosis is the excessive
immune response mediated by CD4+ type 1 helper-like
cells (Th1-cells), including hyperactivation of Th1-cells
and increased levels of Th1 cytokines (Fig. 1). Based on
studies using bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) sam-
ples, it has been documented that in patients with pul-
is
monary sarcoidosis,
characterized by a Th1/Th2 imbalance in which Th1-
related cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12,
interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-
α) promote a persistent inflammatory response in the af-
fected tissues [29]. For example, both IL-2 and IFN-γ are
potent inducer of T cell proliferation and TNF-α pro-
motes the differentiation of macrophages into giant cells
and contributes to granuloma formation [164].

the local microenvironment

Another subset of CD4T-lymphocytes, involvement in
granuloma induction or maintenance in sarcoidosis are
Th17 cells, as documented by the elevated numbers of
IL-17, IL-22 and IFN-γ secreting CD4T-lymphocytes
found in the blood of patients with sarcoidosis, as well
as an increased proportion of Th17 cells, located in and
around sarcoidal granulomas [127, 144, 151]. These find-
ings indicate that Th17 cells are pathogenic in sarcoid-
osis and suggest that the inhibition of both Th1/Th17
pathways may be required to achieve therapeutic efficacy
in sarcoidosis patients [66].

Regulatory cells (Treg cells), which are defined as
CD4+CD25brightFoxP3+ have been also implicated in the
pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. Treg cells are a subset of lym-
phocytes that inhibit autoimmune reactions by controlling
the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes via se-
cretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin

10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) or
through mechanisms dependent on cell contact via the
CD25 molecules constitutively expressed on their surfaces
[127]. High number of Treg cells are frequently found in
lymph nodes and in BALF of patients with sarcoidosis and
accumulate at the periphery of sarcoid granulomas. Not-
ably, although these cells exhibit powerful antiproliferative
activity, they fail to completely inhibit TNF-α production
[29] likely due their increased apoptotic susceptibility [18].
Contrary to the local dysfunction of granuloma associated

Treg cells, increased circulating Treg cells have been docu-
mented in the blood of patients with sarcoidosis, which
may explain the apparent immune anergy frequently ob-
served in these patients. Experimental studies have shown
that Treg depletion accelerates in vitro granuloma growth
in mononuclear cell cultures of healthy controls, but not in
those from patients with active sarcoidosis indicating that,
although healthy Tregs suppress the initial steps of granu-
loma formation, they have no positive influence on sarcoid-
osis lesions [142]. Notably, a significant increase in the

Fig. 1 Legend of the figure. A schematic model for granuloma formation. a Dendritic cells pick up the initiating antigen (likely an environmental
airborne antigen or a microbe) and migrate toward lymph nodes, where they interact with appropriate T cells, promoting the differentiation and
clonal expansion of T helper (Th)1 and 17 cells. Activated Th1 and Th17 cells promote an inflammatory response via the release of cytokines such
as interferon γ (INF-γ), interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-17 contributing to granuloma formation. b Microbes, such as mycobacteria or C. acnes, may
directly infect monocytes or macrophages, which fail to properly eliminate the infection and in turn differentiate into giant cells or epithelioid
cells. Simultaneously, giant cells or epithelioid cells produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which promotes the formation and maintenance of
sarcoid granulomas. In addition, by secreting MCP-1 and CXCL10 chemokines, macrophages attract Th1/17 cells, monocytes, regulatory T cells
(Tregs). These Tregs fail to control the inflammatory response and secrete transforming grow factor β (TGF- β) that may contribute to fibrosis and
granuloma organization (c) An altered composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) of the gut or lungs may act as a source of microbes that secrete
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may activate immune cells of the innate system, such as monocytes or eosinophils, by
interacting with pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) like toll-like receptors (TLRs) and in the presence of sustained activation, it may further
promote the generation of giant cells and epithelioid cells from macrophages and thereby contribute to granuloma formation via the secretion
of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-α

Th17/Treg cell ratio has been reported in sarcoidosis pa-
tients [78], which is consistent with other studies reporting
that in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in relapse after
corticosteroid withdrawal, a significant increase in circulat-
ing Th17 cell along with a concomitant decrease in Treg
cell has been documented [95]. Interestingly, a recent
study that analyzed samples from airways obtained by
BAF, Tregs from the lung of sarcoidosis patients were
characterized by expressing high levels of the receptor
CD278 on their surface and such a CD278 expressing
Tregs cells were restricted to the inflamed lungs and were
absent in blood Tregs of sarcoidosis patients as well as in
lung and blood Tregs of healthy volunteers. Strikingly,
CD278 expression was particularly high on Tregs derived
from the lungs of Löfgren’s syndrome patients who
present with acute disease and that often resolves spon-
taneously [128] indicating that CD278 may be a marker of
disease activity and could be considered a biomarker for
the prognosis of sarcoidosis.

Pathogenesis of sarcoidosis: genetics and environmental
factors
The appearance of familiarly clustered cases of sarcoid-
osis and the racial differences in disease incidence and
clinical progression support a possible link of genetics
with the development of this disease [104, 116, 154].
These observations are substantiated by the findings of a
large study recently conducted in Sweden that included
23 880 individuals with sarcoidosis assessed between1964
to 2013 and matched (10:1) to general population con-
trols. A heritable link was tracked in 39% of cases (95%
CI 12–65) analyzed and having ≥1 first degree relative
with sarcoidosis was associated with a 3.7-fold increase
in the risk for sarcoidosis (95% CI 3.4–4.1) and the risk
increased in those with ≥2 relatives (RR 4.7) and in Löfg-
ren’s syndrome (RR 4.1) [123].

The most strongly and consistently associated risk fac-
tor for sarcoidosis is the major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) region, comprising of HLA class I (HLA-A,
−B, and -C) and class II (HLA-DP, −DQ, and -DR)
genes, being HLA class II variants, particularly HLA-
DRB1 and DQB1 the alleles most prevalently reported in
association with sarcoidosis [60, 158]. For example,
B1*0301/DQB1*0201 is strongly linked with Löfgren’s
syndrome and it predicts good prognosis in various pop-
ulations [71]. A decreased risk of sarcoidosis has been
reported in individuals carrying the HLA class II allele
HLA-DRB1∗01/∗04 (Fingerlin, Hamzeh and Maier, 2015;
[104, 130]). Individuals with the allele HLA-DRB1∗14:01
more likely develop a chronic disease [60, 61, 123], and
those with HLA-DRB1*03:01-DRB3*01:01are more likely
to have pulmonary sarcoidosis [90, 158].

On the other hand, SNPs in non-HLA genes, including
CCR2, CCR5, IL1A, IL23R, TNF-α and NOD2, FCGR,

have been also reported in association with the disease
[61, 121, 139]. It must be noted, however, that many of
these gene-association studies were conducted in single
populations where allele frequencies in sarcoidosis pa-
tients were compared with healthy control
individuals
and most of those studies did not include a confirmatory
cohort. Not surprisingly, only a few of the reported gene
associations have been consistently validated across dis-
tinct populations (Fingerlin, Hamzeh and Maier, 2015).
Interestingly, genetic variants in TNFα gene, as a sus-
ceptibility factor for sarcoidosis, have been replicated
across populations in various studies (Fingerlin, Hamzeh
and Maier, 2015; [104]) and some of them have been
also verified in meta-analyses [59, 138].

Despite that numerous genetic risk factors in associ-
ation with sarcoidosis have been identified, in the major-
ity of cases, the biologic functions of specific variants
and their precise interaction with environmental expo-
sures remain unknown. The use of new generation se-
quencing based HLA typing will be helpful to identify
potential new associations and to elucidate the specific
contribution of particular gene variants, especially within
the HLA region, to disease susceptibility and may pro-
vide new insights on the pathogenesis of this disease.

and moldy

Sarcoidosis has been also linked with certain environ-
ments factors such as exposure to inorganic particles, in-
secticides,
environments. Occupational
studies have also found an increased risk of sarcoidosis
among metalworkers and fire fighters [110]. In a recent
epidemiological study, significantly elevated rates of this
disease were observed among workers that responded to
the world trade center terror attack in 2001. The in-
creased risk was observed among workers at all exposure
levels [157], suggesting that nanoparticles or metal and
chemicals fumes likely derived from the occupational
domain or other environmental contaminant may act as
important triggers of this disease.

Furthermore, tattoos-induced sarcoidosis has been de-
scribed in the literature, and although the etiology of this
phenomenon is unknown, it has been attributed to an ex-
cessive immune reaction against pigment particles, in gen-
etically predisposed individuals. Notably, the sarcoidal
granulomas, contain pigment particles, pigment laden
macrophages and polarizing material and some patients
may develop symptoms of pulmonary sarcoidosis [118].

In line with these observations, it has been proposed
that sarcoid formation may occur in the context of infec-
tious and non-infectious causes, depending on the genetic
background of the host. In this model, the exposure to
certain microorganisms expressing microbial hsps or
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which
are sensed by immune cells via pattern recognition recep-
tors (PRR), may generate an increased and persistent re-
lease of both human HSPs and microbial hsp. Given the

Inaoka et al. Journal of Biomedical Science           (2019) 26:45 

Page 7 of 19

high homology of mycobacterial hsp, particularly myco-
bacterium tuberculosis hsp (mTB-hsp) and HSP, this may
lead to an excessive immune response that ultimately may
cause sarcoidosis. On the other hand, in non-infectious
causes of sarcoidosis, the persistent exposure to an array
of damaging factors such as phagocyted metal fumes, pig-
ments and other chemicals may result in the release of
(DAMPs), also
damage-associated molecular patterns
known as danger-associated molecular patterns, which are
host biomolecules capable of initiating and perpetuating a
noninfectious inflammatory response [37].

Intriguingly, patients with sarcoidosis have increased
risk of developing lymphomas, a condition that has been
called sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome, with sarcoidosis
preceding lymphoma in most cases, though sarcoidosis
following lymphoma has been also reported [96] and
sarcoidosis or sarcoid-like granulomas are being fre-
quently reported in patients with cancer, particularly in
patients receiving immunotherapy with immune check-
point inhibitors [32, 55, 69, 146], which has been attrib-
uted to an excessive immune response against cancer
cells, which may be activated by immunotherapy agents
and thus substantiating the critical role that an excessive
immune response plays in the pathogenesis of sarcoid-
osis. Experimental data indicate that the immune check
point blockade augments the number of circulating
Th17 CD4+ cells along with an increased production of
proinflammatory molecules, such as IL-6 and TNF-α
[69, 156], which may promote the formation of granu-
lomatous/sarcoid-like lesions.
Interestingly, a recent
study showed that PD-1 pathway is upregulated in sar-
coidosis. In this study, sarcoidal PD-1 + CD4 + T cells
displayed reduced proliferation rate, their proliferation
capacity could be recovered after treatment with anti-
PD-1[17]. These findings suggest a potential benefit and
a dual role of PD-1 blockade in sarcoidosis in an analo-
gous way as TNF-α blockers.

Microbes and sarcoidosis
The potential involvement of microbes in the pathogen-
esis of sarcoidosis was proposed many years ago [35, 49].
This was mainly based on the observations that granu-
lomas observed in sarcoidosis share certain histological
similarities with the granulomatous lesions caused by
pathogen infections such as leprosy, tuberculosis and
some parasitic infections [2, 148]. To identify potential
pathogens
of
sarcoidosis-specimens have been analyzed utilizing sev-
eral techniques,
including microbe culture, real time
immunohistochemistry and proteomic and gen-
PCR,
omic studies [25, 47]. As a result, various microorgan-
isms have been detected in sarcoid granulomas and
other tissues affected by sarcoidosis, which suggests that
microbes may have a role in the pathogenesis of this

a

disease [22, 25, 35, 97]. However, it is important to no-
tice that most of the putative microorganisms have been
identified at genomic levels (DNA or RNA) and only a
few studies have documented the presence of microbes
using bacteriological or proteomic methods (Table 2).
The considerable variation among different reports and
the fact that the presumptive microbes are not detect-
able in all sarcoidal granulomas or in all patients ana-
lyzed, along with the detection of those microorganisms,
even in tissues of normal individuals or in samples de-
rived from patients with other diseases, constitute im-
and
portant
therefore, current evidence does not support a direct
causative role of microbes in sarcoidosis.

the microbial

limitations of

theory

In addition, a putative involvement of microbes in the
pathogenesis of sarcoidosis is indirectly supported by
studies reporting considerable activation PRRs, which
are essential components of the innate immune system
involved in the control of
infective microorganisms.
Among the altered PRRs, enhanced expression toll-like
receptors (TLR) and their activated downstream signals
have been documented in various cell subsets of patients
with sarcoidosis. For example, a study that assessed glo-
bal transcriptomic changes of miRNAs of circulating
Tregs and CD4+/CD25 + Tregs from BAL, identified al-
terations in TLR-2 signaling pathway. Notably, induction
of TLR-2 expression was found not only in Tregs, but
also in the heterogeneous population of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of patients with pulmonary sarcoid-
osis [85]. In addition, increased inflammatory cytokine
secretion was reported when immune cells obtained
from BAL of sarcoidosis patients were in vitro exposed
to LpqH, a 19kd lipoprotein of mTB, that is a ligand of
TLR2[64]. In the same study, TLR-2 gene deletion in a
murine model of Th1-associated lung disease induced by
heat-killed C. acnes, resulted in a considerable attenuation
of the granulomatous pulmonary inflammation compared
to wild-type C57BL/6 animals [64]. Another study found a
significant association between TLR9 expression and
CD4+ lymphocytes in BAL of patients with sarcoidosis. In-
creased TLR9 expression in alveolar macrophages derived
from patients with sarcoidosis was also reported and these
cells secreted higher levels of cytokines in response to in
vitro stimulation [134]. TLR9 is an important receptor
mainly expressed by dendritic cells, macrophages and NK
cells that recognizes specific unmethylated CpG motifs of
DNA present in bacteria and viruses. This receptor trig-
gers signaling cascades leading to a pro-inflammatory
cytokine response has attracted considerable attention for
its immunotherapeutic potential [58].

So far, the most comprehensive study aimed to clarify
the role of microbes in sarcoidosis is a meta-analysis that
included 58 case–control studies (involving more than
reporting the
6000 patients

in several

countries)

presence of microorganisms in samples of patients with
sarcoidosis using culture methods or molecular biology
techniques concluded that an etiological link exists be-
tween C. acnes and sarcoidosis (OR 18.80, 95% CI 12.62,
28.01). Strong association was also found with mycobac-
terium tuberculosis (mTB), as this bacterium was detected
within the sarcoidal lesions of nearly 25% of sarcoidosis
including Borrelia,
patients (OR 6.8). Other microbes,
HHV-8, as well as Rickettsia helvetica, Chlamydia pneu-
moniae, Epstein-Barr virus and Retrovirus were not asso-
ciated with sarcoidosis [54]. In the next section, we will
discuss additional studies supporting a causal association
between C. acnes and mTB with sarcoidosis.

Role of C. acnes and sarcoidosis
C. acnes,
is a slow-growing anaerobic Gram-positive
bacterium rod that is etiologically linked to the skin dis-
order acne. In addition, C. acnes can cause chronic
blepharitis, and endophthalmitis and is an opportunistic
agent that can cause endocarditis, corneal ulcer, septic
arthritis and is a contaminating agent of areas subcuta-
neous such as after craniotomy. This bacterium is largely
commensal and part of the skin microbiota detectable
on healthiest adult humans’ skin and may be also found
throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

tissues [5],

C. acnes can be found in BAL of the majority of pa-
tients with sarcoidosis and its presence has been associ-
ated with disease activity, however the microbe can be
also found in around 20% of controls [46]. In addition,
C. acnes has been identified in granulomas and inflam-
matory cells of myocardial
lymph nodes
[141] neurological system [160], the granulomas present
in the epiretinal membrane excised from patients with
uveitis associated with sarcoidosis [70] and many other
sarcoidal granuloma specimens. Importantly, C. acnes
constitutes the only microorganisms that has been iso-
lated from sarcoidal specimens by bacterial culture [47].
One of the first attempts to systematically study a po-
tential link between sarcoidosis and pathogens was an
international study included formalin-fixed and paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) sections of lymph nodes of patients
from Japan, Italy, Germany, and England. The specimens
(108 sarcoidosis, 65 tuberculosis and 86 control samples)
were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR to identify
genomes of C. acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum,
mTB, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis,
and Escherichia coli (as the control). The authors con-
cluded that Propionibacterium spp. are more likely than
Mycobacteria spp. to be involved in the etiology of sar-
coidosis and the association occurred not only in Japa-
nese but also in European patients with sarcoidosis [48].
High frequency of C. acnes genomes were also found in
FFPE derived from Chinese patients with sarcoidosis but
not in tuberculosis or lung cancer [163].

Negi and colleagues examined formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded samples of lungs and lymph nodes
from 196 patients with sarcoidosis, as well as control
samples derived from 275 patients with non-sarcoidosis
diseases. Using immunohistochemistry with C. acnes-
specific monoclonal antibodies that react with cell-
membrane-bound lipoteichoic acid (PAB antibody), the
authors detected small round bodies within sarcoid
granulomas in 20/27 (74%) video-assisted thoracic sur-
gery lung samples, 24/50 (48%) transbronchial lung bi-
opsy
lymph node
samples, and 34/38 (89%) German lymph node samples.
Notably, PAB antibody did not react with non-sarcoid
granulomas in any of the 45 tuberculosis samples or the
34 samples with sarcoid reaction, suggesting that this in-
digenous bacterium might be the cause of granuloma
formation in many sarcoid patients [108].

samples, 71/81 (88%)

Japanese

C. acnes secretes propionic acid and other short-chain
fatty acids metabolites (SCFAs) such as formic acid (C1),
acetic acid (C2), butyric acid (C4), and valeric acid (C5).
Interesting SCFAs secreted by gut microbiota exert
modulatory effects on the immune system, including the
differentiation and proliferation of Treg cells [4, 89], and
regulate the production of blood cells in the bone mar-
row in the mouse [88, 150].

One may expect that propionic acid released by C. acnes
may promote the proliferation of Treg cells and thus it
could theoretically prevent the development of sarcoidosis
rather that promoting granuloma formation, however, in
individuals with new onset pulmonary sarcoidosis, a large
infiltration of Treg cells, along with Treg cytokines such
as IL-10 and TGF-β are increased but are not functional
[29]. Therefore, it is plausible that Treg induction via ex-
cessive production of propionic acid in the site of inflam-
mation may promote granuloma formation in sarcoidosis,
however more controlled studies, using more individuals
and testing tissues from other organs affected by sarcoid-
osis are needed to clarify these issues.

In summary, there is abundant laboratory and clinical
evidence supporting an association between sarcoidosis
and C. acnes, however is worthy to notice that the vast
majority of the studies reported so far have been con-
ducted by Japanese groups testing Japanese patients,
while only a few testing specimens obtained from pa-
tients from African American or Caucasian patients hav-
ing been published. More studies are needed to
demonstrate a direct causal link between this pathogen
and sarcoidosis.

Role of mTB in sarcoidosis
The link between mTB and sarcoidosis was proposed
many years ago [76] given the fact that sometimes dis-
tinguishing between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis in the

tuberculosis cases with atypical presentation or in areas
where tuberculosis is endemic [105]. The differential
diagnosis sometimes is difficult because both diseases
mainly affect the lungs and frequently involve the en-
largement of mediastinal, perihilar and other thoracic
lymph nodes with marked radiological similarities [101].
In addition, both diseases may present with similar
extrapulmonary manifestations in the skin, kidneys and
musculoskeletal system and may cause systemic symp-
toms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss [94]. More-
over, the presence of granulomas is a histopathological
features shared by both diseases and, although tubercu-
losis typically causes caseating granulomas, some pa-
tients may present with non-caseating granulomas [8].
Furthermore, as mentioned before, current standard
treatment of sarcoidosis involves the administration of
corticosteroids whose prolonged use results in immuno-
suppression. As a result, latent tuberculosis reactivation
is relatively frequent in sarcoidosis patients taking corti-
costeroids adding an additional layer of complexity to
the distinction between the two diseases [94, 103].

Pathological studies have documented the presence of
mTB-hsps, including mTB-hsp70, mTB-hsp65, and mTB-
hsp16 in lymph node tissues of patients with sarcoidosis,
being mTB-hsp16 predominantly detected in the early
stage of the disease and mTB-hsp70 in stage II sarcoidosis
[38]. As expected, mTB-hsps are also detectable in tuber-
culosis, however higher nitrate/nitrite concentrations are
observed tuberculosis than in sarcoidosis. Since nitrite
produced by mTB in infected macrophages modulates
mycobacterial survival [27],
it has been proposed that
lower levels of nitrate/nitrite may induce a “mTB genetic
dormancy program” via higher mTB-hsp16 expression fa-
vorable for the development of sarcoidosis [39]. Given the
structural similarities between mTB-hsps and human-
HSP, it has been proposed that the exposure to mycobac-
terial antigens via either natural infection, or by vaccin-
ation with BCG, may induce an autoimmune response in
genetically prone individuals that may result in sarcoidosis
[36]. In line with these observations, in patients with sar-
coidosis, specific antibodies to these mycobacterial anti-
gens (anti- mTB-hsps) are frequently detected in serum
samples. Interestingly, in comparison with tuberculosis,
significantly higher levels of anti-mTB-hsp70 antibodies
are observed in sarcoidosis patients [40].

There is a relative high prevalence of sarcoidosis in
certain countries of northern Europe and for many years
it was assumed that whereas sarcoidosis was a disease of
the developed world, tuberculosis was a disease that
mainly affect people in the developing world [6]. How-
ever, with the introduction of new diagnostic modalities
such as high resolution computed tomography, and
transbronchial lymph node and lung biopsies, sarcoid-
osis cases in developing countries are being increasingly

detected and thus recent reports suggest that sarcoidosis
is a worldwide disease.

Early observations published during the mid-twentieth
reported the presence of mTB bacilli-like structures
identified by bacteriological methods in inflamed tissues
of some patients with suspected sarcoidosis [26, 120,
133], although those findings were not consistently ob-
served in all the specimens examined and some of the
patients studied may have indeed presented both dis-
eases concomitantly (tuberculosis and sarcoidosis), given
the higher prevalence of tuberculosis in that period and
the fact that immunological anergy associated with sar-
coidosis is a risk factor for the development of tubercu-
losis. With the introduction of the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis in medical research at the begin-
ning of the 1990s, several investigators independently re-
ported the finding that mycobacterial DNA can be
frequently detected in tissues specimens from patients
with sarcoidosis [68, 124] and the causal
link of this
mTB and other mycobacteria with sarcoidosis was fur-
ther tested in the following decade using more advanced
microbiological and molecular techniques [112, 145].

A meta-analysis assessing the molecular evidence of
the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis analyzed 31 stud-
ies in which PCR for nucleic acid amplification followed
by identification of nucleic acid sequences specific for
different types of mycobacteria concluded that 231 out
of 874 patients were positive for mycobacteria with a
positive signal rate of 26.4 (23.6–29.5%), and the odds of
finding mycobacteria in samples of patients with sar-
coidosis versus controls were 9.67 (4.56–20.5%). It must
be noted however that methodological and statistical
heterogeneity and publication bias was evident in most
of the studies assessed [72]. However, similar results
were reported by another meta-analysis that assessed 36
different studies (1034 sarcoidosis patients and 1054
control), where the positive signal rate was 24.2% (250
sarcoidosis samples were positive for some form of
mycobacteria DNA) [54].

A comprehensive assessment of immune infiltration of
sarcoidosis or tuberculosis granulomas using immunohisto-
chemistry revealed that, although there was no significance
difference in single CD4+, CD8+, CD22+, CD14+ and
CD68+ staining between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis sec-
tions, CD163 expression (a marker of M2 macrophages)
was significantly increased in sarcoidosis sections compared
with those from tuberculosis [136]. Although the study was
limited by the small number of samples analyzed (10 sar-
coidosis and 12 tuberculosis), these observations indicate
that M2 macrophages may exert a functional role of in the
immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis. Human CD14+ mono-
cytes have the potential to differentiate into two function-
ally distinct subpopulations M1 and M2 macrophages.
Notably, M2 macrophages, also known as “product of Th2

Page 12 of 19

activation”, are the result of macrophage polarization driven
by immunoregulatory cytokines such IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-
β and tumor-infiltrating macrophages are typically classified
as M2 and are well-known to promote malignant cells
growing and immune evasion [99]. Interestingly, circulating
CD14(+) monocytes from patients with sarcoidosis have al-
tered expression of FcγR (CD16, CD32, and CD64) and
complement receptors, along with increased phagocytic ac-
tivity, which appear to be implicated in the high antigen
load and increased circulating immune complexes observed
in this disease [43].

Mycobacterial or their products can exert differential
effects on immune from patients with sarcoidosis. For
example, higher percentages of CD8(+) αβ (+) T-cells,
with a concomitant
increase in the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines was observed when peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with
sarcoidosis were stimulated in vitro with Mtb-hsp,
in
comparison with PBMCs from controls or from patients
with tuberculosis [42]. Notably, monocytes from patients
with sarcoidosis are less sensitive to apoptosis induced
by mycobacterial mTB-hsp in comparison with mono-
cytes derived from patients with tuberculosis or from
healthy individuals [41]. The immunomodulatory effects
of mycobacterial products have been verified in meta-
analysis that included 733 participants from 13 case-
control studies revealing a significantly higher immune
response in sarcoidosis patients than in controls, which
suggests an association to exist between mycobacteria
(especially mTB) and sarcoidosis [56].

Taken together, the above discussed evidence appear
to link mTB, other mycobacteria or their products with
the excessive immune responses leading to sarcoidosis
in a proportion of patients with sarcoidosis. Although
this association in unlikely to occur in all patients and
may be more significant in countries where tuberculosis
is endemic.

Potential implications of microbiota in sarcoidosis
Human microbiota composition is functionally impli-
cated in the regulation of several physiological processes,
including metabolic functions and immune homeostasis.
Although gut microbiota is the most studied human
microbiota niche, well-defined microbiota communities
have been identified in virtually any body niche, includ-
ing the skin and the respiratory tract [24, 53, 111]. In
addition, the use of novel microbiome analysis tech-
niques has shown that even internal structures such as
the blood vessels, may have their own microbiota niche
[51]. Alterations in the composition of this community
of microorganisms has been associated with the develop-
ment of several inflammatory disorders including cancer
and autoimmune diseases [53, 92].

Microbiome analysis in healthy individuals reveal that
airway and lung microbiome composition is similar to
oropharyngeal microbiome with no evidence of site spe-
cific enrichment of bacterial communities indicating and
the presence of certain microorganisms, which reach the
lungs mainly via passive microaspiration, may directly
modulates local immune responses [31]. Not surprisingly
changes in microbe composition of the respiratory niche
has been associated with inflammatory diseases [24,
140]. Since sarcoidosis manifests as a respiratory disease
in more than 90% of patients, one may anticipate that
the disease may be associated with specific changes in
the composition of lung microbiota. Interestingly, Gar-
zoni and colleagues analyzed the microbiome compos-
ition in BAL specimens of the lungs and respiratory
tracts of individuals with sarcoidosis or with idiopathic
interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and did not find any differ-
ence in the microbiome profiles of the analyzed patients
[65]. It must be noted however, that although specimens
were prospective analyzed, crucial
limitations in this
study were the small number of individuals analyzed (7
patients with sarcoidosis, 5 patients with IIP and 6 with
non-IIP) and the heterogeneity of the subjects involved
in the study. In addition, though microbiome compos-
ition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of
BAL specimens, no extensive ultra-deep sequencing of
viruses and fungi in the collection of samples was per-
formed. In contrast, another study that included 71 pa-
tients with sarcoidosis, 15 patients with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis and 10 healthy controls found that
Atopobium spp. was detectable in 68% of sarcoidosis
specimens but in none of healthy controls. Similarly,
Fusobacterium spp. were also identified as sarcoidosis-
associated bacteria. In the same study, gene association

specimens (19 Kveim reagent and one fresh spleen) that

fungi

had been prepared under sterile conditions were also an-
alyzed. Specimens were interrogated using diverse se-
quencing strategies including 16S ribosomal RNA gene
sequencing (for bacterial analysis), shotgun metage-
nomics (for virus analysis) and internal transcribed spa-
cer ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (for fungi). In one
tissue set,
in the Cladosporiaceae family were
enriched in sarcoidosis compared with nonsarcoidosis
tissues; in the other tissue set, several bacterial lineages
were enrichment in sarcoidosis but not Cladosporiaceae.
In BAL fluid samples, Corynebacteria was enriched along
with a limited enrichment of Aspergillus fungi. Interest-
ingly, in the 20 sterile-collected samples available (Kveim
and spleen tissue), whole-genome shotgun sequencing
analysis revealed the enrichment of several microbial line-
ages, especially Cladosporium [22]. Despite these promis-
ing candidates, the study did not identify any microbe
signature associated with sarcoidosis, namely, no single
causative microbe was consistently enriched across tissue
specimen types in patients with sarcoidosis.

However,

it must be noted that there were various
technical
limitations associated with this study. First,
most samples utilized in this study were FFPE and for-
malin degrades DNA and also it is well-known that the
de-crosslinking step necessary to undo the formalin fix-
ation results in DNA damage which may have impaired
the sensitivity for microbe detection in these samples. In
addition, although in this study various negative control
specimens, representing a variety of potential sources of
contamination, were analyzed to exclude false positive
findings, the fact that mycobacteria and Propionibacteria
(which have been linked with sarcoidosis in previous
studies) may be present in both environmental controls
and patient tissues, along with the fact that mycobacteria
DNA extraction is difficult, likely contributed to the false
negative results reported in the study. Finally, spleen and
Kveim specimens were not matched with negative con-
trol human specimens. A recent study that included
16sRNA gene sequencing of bronchoscopy obtained
specimens from 31 patients with sarcoidosis and 19 with
interstitial lung disease found no significant differences
in the microbiome composition between the two groups,
being Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Acinetobacter, Bacteroi-
detes, Fusobacteriales, and Spirochaetales the most dom-
inant microorganisms
identified. The absence of a
healthy control group and the heterogeneity of the inter-
stitial lung disease group were important limitations in
this study [13].

Furthermore, as previous studies have shown, alter-
ations in the gut microbiome may result in the develop-
ment of
such as
systemic inflammatory conditions,
rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis [75, 117, 143],
which can be attributed to the pivotal role that gut micro-
biota play in the modulation of systemic immune response

via the education of various subsets of immune cells, espe-
cially Treg cells and Th17 cells [4, 52, 106]. Is dysbiosis of
the gut associated with the development or progression of
sarcoidosis? To the best of our knowledge, no studies sys-
tematically assessing the gut microbiome composition in
patients with sarcoidosis have been reported so far. Fur-
ther studies including larger number of individuals with
appropriate controls, utilizing not only freshly isolated sar-
coidal specimens prepared under sterile condition, but
also the gut microbiome are needed to elucidate a poten-
tial role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Antimicrobials for the treatment of sarcoidosis
One may speculate that using antibiotics capable of eradi-
cating microbes potentially linked with sarcoidosis such as
C. acnes or Mtb could modify the clinical course of the dis-
ease. Indeed, a few studies testing the clinical efficacy of an-
tibiotics for sarcoidosis have been reported, although most
studies have been conducted in small series of cases and es-
sentially in patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis. Measurable
clinical response was observed in 10 of the 12 patients with
cutaneous sarcoidosis treated with either minocycline or
doxycycline, although no control group was included in this
small study [7]. In a randomized, placebo-controlled single-
masked trial that enrolled 30 patients with symptomatic
chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions, Drake et al. reported
significant clinically improvements in patients receiving oral
antibiotics. In this study, subjects received either a combin-
ation of levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, and rifam-
pin (CLEAR regimen) or a placebo for 8 weeks with a 180-
day follow-up [33]. The same group reported a significant
improvement in forced vital capacity from baseline and bet-
ter quality-of-life in 15 patients with chronic pulmonary
sarcoidosis who received the CLEAR regimen for 8 weeks.
The investigators also observed a normalization in the ex-
pression of tyrosine kinase Lck and NF-κB signals in the
leukocytes of patients treated with the CLEAR regimen, in-
dicating that antimicrobials reduced immune cell hyperacti-
vation associated with the disease [34].

Although some studies utilizing electron microscopic
images and various molecular biology techniques have re-
ported the presence of infective C. acnes within the granu-
lomas from some patients with sarcoidosis [47, 108], the
reproducibility of those findings in a large number of pa-
tients from different populations and presenting with dis-
tinct disease phenotypes remains to be seen. In addition, it
is important to consider that sarcoid granulomas consti-
tute a chronic inflammation, rather than an acute inflam-
matory response and thus, even if microorganisms are the
triggering factor, antibiotics could be ineffective due to the
absence of an active infection within granulomas. Indeed,
some studies have reported no clinical response in sar-
coidosis patients treated with antibiotics [149].

trial

Currently, a multicenter open-label clinical

(J-
ACNES) of sarcoidosis is being conducted in Japan. This
study, which is the largest so far, will assess the clinical re-
sponse of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis in response to
antibiotic therapy for which patients will be randomized
to receive either standard corticosteroid therapy plus anti-
biotic therapy (with known activity against C. acnes) or
standard corticosteroid therapy alone [80]. Similarly, the
utility of antibiotics is also being tested in other clinical
trials of sarcoidosis in the USA and Canada (clinicaltrials.-
gov NCT02024555 and NCT01245036), substantiating
the importance of the microbial hypothesis in the patho-
genesis of sarcoidosis.

Whether or not microbes are causally implicated in
the development of sarcoidosis is unclear at present.
Further studies are needed in order to conclude or rule
out a causal relationship between infections and sarcoid-
osis. In this regard, the utilization of artificial intelligence
(AI) tools may be very useful for this purpose, since AI
has tremendous potential in the development of algo-
rithms for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of
complex human diseases. AI can integrate large number
of data encompassing laboratory data, imaging studies,
and clinical data to better characterize disease and devel-
oping predictive models [50, 114].

Concluding remarks and future directions
For more than one century, utilizing a variety of ap-
proaches and testing numerous specimens, researchers
have tried to identify the cause of sarcoidosis to ultim-
ately design a cure for this disease. Some of those studies
have provided important insights for understanding the
etiology of the sarcoidosis. For example, immunohisto-
chemistry and molecular biology studies have delineated
the cellular components of sarcoidal granulomas and the
unique features that distinguish sarcoidosis from other
granulomatous disorders including tuberculosis. Gene
association studies have identified genetic risk factors of
sarcoidosis and epidemiological studies have contributed
to identify specific environmental and occupational fac-
tors strongly associated with the disease.

Several studies have tested the hypothesis that microbes
may be the cause of sarcoidosis and among the numerous
microorganisms investigated, mTB and C. acnes appear to
be the strongest candidates. Although current evidence
does not support a direct causal role of these pathogens in
sarcoidosis, some studies have reported encouraging re-
sults on the potential utility of antibiotics for the manage-
ment of patients with sarcoidosis and there is a great
expectation about the results that will generate ongoing
randomized clinical trials of antibiotics in sarcoidosis. Fur-
ther studies are needed to better understand the specific
role of the above mentioned agents in the development of
sarcoidosis. For example, although articles published so

In this
regard, the utilization of machine learning and deep

causal associations that are undetectable using stand-
