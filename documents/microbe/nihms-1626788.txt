Abstract

Iron is an essential micronutrient for nearly all living organisms. In addition to facilitating redox 
reactions, iron is bound by metalloproteins that participate in a variety of biological processes. As 
the bioavailability of free iron in host environments is extremely low, iron lies at the center of a 
battle for nutrients between microbes and their host. Mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory and 
gastrointestinal tracts are constantly exposed to commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. 
Whereas a key strategy of mammalian antimicrobial defense is to deprive microbes of iron, 
pathogens and some commensals have evolved effective strategies to circumvent iron limitation. 
Here we provide an overview of mechanisms underpinning the tug-of-war for iron between 
microbes and their host, with a particular focus on mucosal surfaces.

1. 

Introduction

Iron (Fe) is a vital micronutrient for nearly all forms of life, and is involved in critical 
physiological processes including oxygen transportation, energy metabolism, and DNA 
replication (Lieu et al., 2001). By existing primarily in two oxidation states, ferrous (Fe2+) 
and ferric (Fe3+) iron, this element has the flexibility to serve as a key cofactor in many 
enzymes as well as play a crucial role in facilitating a variety of redox reactions. 
Nevertheless, despite iron’s essential roles in the beneficial chemistry of life, its redox 
potential can negatively impact biological molecules and cells; for example, the Fenton 
reaction involving Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide yields reactive oxygen species (ROS) that 
can damage biomolecules including lipids, proteins, and DNA. Oxidative stress, in turn, is 
linked to aging, cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (Liu et al., 
2018). To minimize iron’s reactivity and toxicity, the vast majority of iron in mammals is 
found in intracellular compartments, complexed with hemoproteins (e.g., hemoglobin,

myoglobin), or the iron-storage protein ferritin (Lieu et al., 2001). Thus, the bioavailability 
of free iron is low in the mammalian environment, even during homeostasis. Moreover, in a 
process known as nutritional immunity, extracellular and intracellular iron is further 
decreased during infection to prevent the outgrowth of pathogens (Hood and Skaar, 2012). 
Successful pathogens have therefore evolved strategies to compete for and obtain iron from 
the host in order to replicate and thrive despite limited nutrient availability.

Mucosal surfaces constitute a physical barrier between the external environment and the 
inner body. During homeostasis, many of these surfaces are colonized by an assortment of 
microbes that are collectively referred to as the commensal microbiota, and typically include 
non-pathogenic bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses (Lozupone et al., 2012). Among the 
body sites with a commensal microbiota, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and in particular the 
colon, is home to the body’s largest and most diverse microbial community. The host and its 
commensal microbiota have evolved a mutualistic interdependency that significantly 
contributes to many aspects of the host’s normal physiology, ranging from metabolism, to 
resisting pathogen colonization (Dethlefsen et al., 2007), to shaping and maintaining the 
host’s immune system (Belkaid and Hand, 2014). The host, in turn, provides its microbiota 
with nutrients and environments suitable for growth. Even so, not all microbes are able to 
colonize and/or flourish in a given host, as the availability of specific nutrients controls the 
abundance of certain microbes (Pereira and Berry, 2017). The ability to acquire and utilize 
nutrients is thus essential for commensal microbes to stably colonize their host.

Despite this coevolved mutualism, the mucosal immune system must still prevent 
microorganisms, be they commensals or pathogens, from disseminating beyond mucosal 
surfaces. On this front, iron sequestration by the host represents a conserved innate immune 
mechanism for limiting microbial growth. Nevertheless, pathogens have evolved strategies 
to circumvent these defenses. Here we provide an overview of mechanisms underpinning the 
tug-of-war for iron between microbes and their host, which ultimately determines the health 
of the host and the survival of pathogenic microbes.

Iron regulation in humans

Regulation of iron metabolism is a balance of iron absorption, recycling, and loss. Iron 
levels must be tightly controlled to avoid iron deficiency (which can result in anemia) and to 
prevent toxicity due to excess iron. Trafficking and systemic metabolism of iron have been 
the subject of excellent reviews (e.g., (Hentze et al., 2010)). In this section, we provide a 
brief synopsis. Dietary iron is generally acquired as heme or non-heme iron, and is absorbed 
in the duodenum and proximal jejunum (Hentze et al., 2010). Whereas heme iron is 
efficiently absorbed, likely via receptor-mediated endocytosis, non-heme iron (typically 
ferric iron) has a much lower bioavailability (approximately 10%). In the duodenum, 
insoluble ferric iron (Fe3+) is reduced to the soluble ferrous (Fe2+) form by ferric reductases 
including duodenal cytochrome b (DCYTB). Ferrous iron is then taken up by various iron 
transporters, including its primary transporter DMT1 (also known as NRAMP2). Absorbed 
iron is either utilized by enterocytes, where it is stored in association with ferritin, or 
released into the plasma via the basolateral export protein ferroportin (FPN1). Once in the 
plasma, iron is complexed with transferrin (Tf), then distributed to target organs and cells

such as erythroid precursor cells (Hentze et al., 2010). Of important note, humans lack a 
discrete mechanism for excreting surplus iron from the body, so the body’s total iron content 
is solely regulated at the level of intestinal absorption. Dietary iron absorption and 
distribution throughout the body are governed by the liver hormone hepcidin, the master 
regulator of iron homeostasis (Drakesmith and Prentice, 2012). In addition to maintaining a 
healthy level of iron in the body, hepcidin is also leveraged by the immune system to fight 
infection. One of the first acute phase responses following an infectious and/or inflammatory 
insult is the substantial and rapid decrease of plasma iron. This process, known as 
hypoferremia of inflammation, is cytokine-driven and results in the upregulation of hepcidin, 
which reduces intestinal iron absorption and promotes systemic iron sequestration (Soares 
and Weiss, 2015).

Unabsorbed dietary iron (primarily heme and ferric iron) passes from the small intestine into 
the colon, where it can be scavenged by the microbiota and by pathogens. Indeed, several 
studies have shown that dietary iron and iron fortification can impact the composition of the 
microbiota as well as increase susceptibility to enteric pathogens (e.g., (Jaeggi et al., 2015)). 
This is particularly relevant in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who develop 
anemia (Werner et al., 2011), and is discussed in a section further below. Beyond nourishing 
intestinal microbes, dietary iron can also have a profound impact on host physiology and on 
bacterial pathogenesis at extraintestinal sites (reviewed in (Lopez and Skaar, 2018)). Of note, 
as iron uptake primarily occurs in the proximal small intestine, patients that have their colon 
resected (colectomy) exhibit normal systemic iron levels, unless complications arise. For 
example, pouchitis is a complication resulting from the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis created 
during colectomy of UC patients (Ferrante et al., 2008). Recent studies have established a 
role for the microbiota in the pathophysiology of pouchitis (Machiels et al., 2017), and the 
administration of a probiotic cocktail has been shown to be effective in preventing onset and 
relapses of the disease (Gionchetti et al., 2012; Mimura et al., 2004). Whether and how iron 
impacts the development of pouchitis remains to be established.

3. 

Iron limitation at mucosal surfaces during health and disease

A number of mechanisms contribute to defense at mucosal surfaces, including colonization 
resistance mediated by the microbiota (Sassone-Corsi and Raffatellu, 2015) and microbial 
growth restriction mediated by nutritional immunity (Hood and Skaar, 2012). Iron represents 
an important battleground in both of these processes as it is a key nutrient that must be 
scavenged from the host environment by commensals and by pathogens. On the host side, 
intestinal homeostasis and restriction of pathogen growth at mucosal surfaces are, in part, 
accomplished by the secretion of potent metal-chelating proteins.

Lactoferrin (Lf), a widely conserved protein belonging to the transferrin family, contains two 
binding sites for ferric iron that enable tight but reversible iron sequestration (Ward and 
Conneely, 2004). A variety of functions are attributable to Lf, ranging from antimicrobial 
activities to iron-independent, immunomodulatory roles (Kruzel et al., 2017; Ward and 
Conneely, 2004). Lf’s antimicrobial activity is thus far based on two characterized 
properties: (i) its strong iron-binding capacity; (ii) its high affinity for lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). While predominantly found in milk, Lf is also present in mucosal secretions

including tears as well as bronchial and vaginal mucus (Levay and Viljoen, 1995). Lf is also 
an important component of neutrophil secondary granules and can bind to iron at a low pH, 
a trait that might be beneficial in inflammatory and infectious foci, which are often more 
acidic.

In addition to directly inhibiting pathogen growth in vitro, Lf can also promote colonization 
resistance and general health through shaping the microbiota. A newborn’s immune system 
is immature and thus infants are at higher risk of infection. This susceptibility is partly 
compensated for by passive transfer of maternal antibodies through the placenta and by 
ingestion of human milk. In the latter context, Lf in human milk appears to beneficially 
modulate the neonatal microbiota composition. Although the antimicrobial effects of Lf are 
well supported by in vitro studies, the in vivo role of Lf against pathogens is less well 
defined (Sánchez et al., 1992). Nevertheless, evidence indicates that Lf promotes the growth 
of beneficial bacteria with low iron requirements, including intestinal and vaginal 
Lactobacillus spp. (Vega-Bautista et al., 2019). Moreover, Lf has been shown to promote the 
growth of probiotic strains belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium, which are among the 
first anaerobes to colonize and predominate the gut of breast-fed infants, although this effect 
might be attributable to roles associated with both the iron-bound and the iron-free forms of 
Lf (Vega-Bautista et al., 2019).

Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2; also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], 
siderocalin, or 24p3) is a small glycoprotein secreted by myeloid and epithelial cells in an 
interleukin-22-dependent manner upon infection and inflammation (Flo et al., 2004; 
Raffatellu et al., 2009). Lcn2’s antimicrobial properties derive primarily from its ability to 
bind to a subset of bacterial siderophores, small molecules that are produced by bacteria to 
scavenge iron (described further in Section 4.1). One such siderophore is enterobactin, 
which is produced by commensal and pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the 
family Enterobacteriaceae. By binding to enterobactin, Lcn2 limits bacterial iron acquisition 
and subsequently hampers the growth of enterobactin-dependent microbes (Figure 1) (Flo et 
al., 2004). In addition to siderophore binding, Lcn2 also exhibits activities that include 
inducing cytokines, mediating the recruitment of inflammatory cells, promoting apoptosis, 
and T-cell priming (Moschen et al., 2017).

Calprotectin (CP; a heterodimer of the S100A8 and S100A9 proteins) is another 
antimicrobial host product with metal-chelating properties. Although CP has been widely 
characterized for its roles in scavenging zinc and manganese (Corbin et al., 2008), recent in 
vitro studies indicate that CP can also chelate Fe2+ (Nakashige et al., 2015) and induce Fe 
starvation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii (Wang et al., 2019; 
Zygiel et al., 2019), however an in vivo context for these findings remains to be described. 
Neutrophils are the main source of CP, and release it at sites of infection (Corbin et al., 
2008). Similar to Lf and Lcn2, fecal CP correlates with disease activity in patients with 
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (Zollner et al., 2020), and is thus frequently utilized to 
aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with IBD (Sipponen et al., 2008).

In addition to the iron-binding proteins produced by the host, members of the commensal 
microbiota can also play a key role in limiting iron availability to pathogens. For example,

the probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) deploys multiple iron acquisition systems 
to compete with pathogens in iron-limited environments such as the inflamed gut (Deriu et 
al., 2013).

4.  Microbial iron metabolism, with a focus on Gram-negative bacteria

With the exception of some non-pathogenic lactic acid bacteria and the Lyme disease 
pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, most microorganisms rely on micromolar iron concentrations 
for metabolism and replication(Archibald, 1983; Posey and Gherardini, 2000; Weinberg, 
1978). However, iron in the mammalian host is largely bound to host proteins (e.g., ferritin, 
Tf, Lf, hemoproteins), thereby reducing iron’s toxicity and accessibility. As such, microbes 
have evolved a variety of iron acquisition strategies to colonize iron-limited niches within 
the host, with some bacteria even being able to reside within intracellular compartments. 
Microbial iron acquisition mechanisms include the secretion and uptake of siderophores, and 
the import of host-derived Tf and heme. Many mechanisms of bacterial iron homeostasis are 
regulated at the transcriptional level. Under iron-rich conditions, iron-acquisition 
mechanisms are repressed by Fur, the ferric uptake regulator. Fur is a global iron regulator in 
many characterized Gram-negative (e.g., enterobacteria) and some Gram-positive (e.g., 
Bacillus spp.) bacteria (Miethke and Marahiel, 2007). The diphtheria toxin regulator DtxR 
plays a comparable role in many characterized Gram-positive bacteria with a high genomic 
GC content (e.g., corynebacteria, mycobacteria) (Miethke and Marahiel, 2007). In Gram-
negative bacteria, TonB-dependent receptor complexes play a key role for energizing the 
transport of iron across the bacterial outer membrane via various uptake systems for 
siderophores, heme, or Tf/Lf, among others (Krewulak and Vogel, 2008; Noinaj et al., 
2010). Nevertheless, much like mammals, iron overload can be toxic to bacteria, which is 
why iron assimilation is tightly regulated. Therefore, the mechanisms described below are 
generally expressed in iron-limiting conditions.

4.1.  Siderophore-based iron acquisition systems

Many bacterial species, including members of the microbiota and various human pathogens, 
secrete structurally diverse, high-affinity, iron-chelating molecules known as siderophores 
(Figure 2a) (Crosa, 1989). For many Gram-negative bacteria, siderophores are essential 
virulence factors. Enterobactin, a catecholate-type siderophore, and the related siderophore 
salmochelin, a C-glucosylated derivative of enterobactin, are the most common siderophores 
utilized by enterobacteria such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Salmonella enterica (Figure 1) 
(Raymond et al., 2003). Other siderophores include yersiniabactin (produced by Yersinia 
pestis and Y. enterocolitica, but also by other Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli and 
Klebsiella), aerobactin (E. coli), and vibriobactin (Vibrio cholerae) (Miethke and Marahiel, 
2007). Of note, in a process termed ‘iron piracy’, some bacterial species are capable of 
acquiring siderophores that they do not synthesize, generally termed xenosiderophores (e.g., 
Salmonella and Yersinia acquire, but do not make, ferrioxamine). Moreover, a subset of 
these bacteria do not produce siderophores at all (e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron does not 
produce siderophores, but can acquire enterobactin and salmochelin) (Figure 3b) (Zhu et al., 
2020). As the biosynthesis of siderophores is an energy-intensive process, iron piracy via 
xenosiderophores is a lucrative iron-acquisition mechanism for the non-producing strains. In

addition to bacteria, fungi also produce and uptake siderophores. For reference, in 1952, the 
fungal siderophores ferrichrome and coprogen were among the first siderophores to be 
described (Hesseltine et al., 1952; Neilands, 1952). Furthermore, several fungal species 
including Candida spp. and Saccharomyces spp. engage in iron piracy by importing 
xenosiderophores (Almeida et al., 2009; Winkelmann, 2007).

During iron limitation, microbes release siderophores into the environment to capture iron. 
Importantly, siderophores’ high affinity for ferric iron enables them to outcompete host 
proteins (e.g., Tf) for this metal (Caza and Kronstad, 2013). To recover the captured iron, 
Gram-negative bacteria express outer membrane receptors that import iron-laden 
siderophores in a TonB-dependent fashion. The evolutionary importance of siderophores is 
reflected by the co-evolution of siderophore neutralization strategies by mammals. As 
discussed in Section 3, the host antimicrobial protein Lcn2 efficiently neutralizes bacterial 
enterobactin; accordingly, Lcn2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to infection with 
microbes that utilize enterobactin for iron acquisition (Flo et al., 2004; Moschen et al., 
2016). However, many bacterial pathogens circumvent Lcn2-mediated enterobactin 
sequestration by producing salmochelin, a chemically modified form of enterobactin that 
cannot be bound by Lcn2 (Fischbach et al., 2006; Raffatellu et al., 2009). Thus, salmochelin 
and other “stealth siderophores” enable pathogens to evade host nutritional immunity 
(Figure 1 and Figure 2b).

4.2.  Heme acquisition systems

Heme is comprised of an iron ion bound to a porphyrin ring. Most of the heme in humans is 
associated with intracellular metalloproteins (hemoproteins) including hemoglobin, 
myoglobin, and cytochromes. Many bacterial pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms 
to liberate heme from vertebrate hemoproteins (Runyen-Janecky, 2013). Moreover, although 
free heme is limited and usually scavenged by host hemopexin or serum albumin, small 
amounts can become available to microbes, for example from lysed erythrocytes or from 
host cells damaged during infection (Runyen-Janecky, 2013). In the gut, dietary heme 
represents another source of iron that can be utilized by intestinal bacteria (Figure 2). In 
Gram-negative bacteria, general mechanisms of heme acquisition involve receptors that 
directly bind heme or hemoproteins (e.g., hemoglobin, hemopexin, haptoglobin) or involve 
scavenging and uptake of heme via bacterial hemophores (Runyen-Janecky, 2013). Heme is 
then internalized across the outer membrane via TonB-dependent transport, after which it is 
brought across the cytoplasmic membrane by ABC transporters. Once heme arrives in the 
cytoplasm, specific heme oxygenases cleave the porphyrin ring to release the iron (Runyen-
Janecky, 2013).

One example of a Gram-negative pathogen that relies on heme for its growth is the “heme-
loving” opportunistic human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae, which colonizes the upper 
respiratory tract and is a frequent cause of pneumonia, otitis, and meningitis. The iron-
limited host environment triggers the pathogen to express several heme acquisition systems 
(Hup, HgpA, HgpB, HgpC, HxuA, HxuC), which in turn mediate acquisition of heme 
directly and from various hemoproteins (Runyen-Janecky, 2013).

Alternative bacterial strategies to obtain iron from heme include secreting hemolysins to lyse 
red blood cells or producing proteases that degrade hemoglobin. Such mechanisms are 
employed by several Gram-negative pathogens including pathogenic E. coli, V. cholerae, and 
Bordetella pertussis, as well as by the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (Caza 
and Kronstad, 2013).

Heme uptake is also employed by certain fungal pathogens (Bairwa et al., 2017). The 
polymorphic fungus and opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans can be part of the 
commensal microbiota and inhabit the oral cavity, the GI tract, and/or the female 
reproductive tract. In most individuals, C. albicans is harmless because it is kept under 
control by the microbiota through nutrient competition. However, under circumstances such 
as immunodeficiency, antibiotic treatment, or immunosuppressive therapy, C. albicans can 
cause diseases ranging from cutaneous infections to life-threatening systemic candidiasis 
(Mayer et al., 2013). In addition to xenosiderophore uptake, C. albicans also relies on iron 
acquisition via heme/hemoglobin (Bairwa et al., 2017).

4.3.  Transferrin/lactoferrin receptor-based systems

The iron-carrying host glycoproteins Tf and Lf exhibit structural similarities, and this is 
reflected in the similarities of bacterial Tf and Lf receptors (Gray-Owen and Schyvers, 
1996). Tf in the serum is primarily exploited as a source of iron by pathogens during 
bloodstream or systemic infections, whereas Lf is generally leveraged by pathogens at 
mucosal surfaces (Morgenthau et al., 2013). Tf and Lf can be exploited by pathogens 
expressing bacterial outer membrane receptors including transferrin-binding-protein A and 
B (TbpAB) and lactoferrin-binding-protein A and B (LbpAB), respectively (Morgenthau et 
al., 2013). Both uptake systems function in a similar fashion in that the receptors remove 
ferric iron from Tf or Lf, and then transport the iron across the outer membrane in a TonB-
dependent manner (Caza and Kronstad, 2013; Morgenthau et al., 2013). The specific 
mechanisms and the order of the steps, however, remain to be elucidated. The utilization of 
Tf or Lf as iron sources has been described for important human pathogens including 
Neisseria spp. and Helicobacter pylori (Caza and Kronstad, 2013; Morgenthau et al., 2013).

5.  Regulation of mucosal iron metabolism during infection and 

inflammation

Mucosal surfaces including the eyes and oropharynx, as well as the GI, respiratory, and 
urogenital tracts, use various antimicrobial defense strategies that interfere with microbial 
adhesion and survival. Among these defenses is the upregulation of Lf and Lcn2. Although 
both host proteins play additional roles in other cells and body sites (Kruzel et al., 2017; 
Moschen et al., 2017), here we focus on their roles at mucosal surfaces.

5.1 

Iron metabolism during intestinal inflammation

The lower GI tract is a complex ecosystem and harbors the most abundant and diverse 
microbial community of the human body (Huttenhower et al., 2012). The commensal gut 
microbiota is dominated by anaerobic microbes that mainly belong to the phyla Firmicutes 
and Bacteroidetes. E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae family members (belonging to the

phylum Proteobacteria) typically comprise a minor fraction of the microbiota in the non-
inflamed gut. One of the main mechanisms by which beneficial commensal microbes 
prevent the outgrowth of potentially harmful microbes is through the competition for iron. In 
the healthy gut, commensal microbes consume available micronutrients and heme, which 
provides an ideal environment for the microbiota to reside in. In turn, the gut microbiota 
provides a variety of beneficial metabolites to the host, such as B vitamins (Celis and 
Relman, 2020). This mutual relationship between the host and commensal microbes makes 
it difficult for pathogens to become established in these densely colonized host 
compartments (Vonaesch et al., 2018) (Figure. 3a).

Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors modulate the microbiota’s composition. For 
example, intestinal inflammation (regardless of etiology) and antibiotic administration have 
a major impact on the microbiota which is typified by a decrease in microbial diversity 
(Bäumler and Sperandio, 2016). The inflamed gut exhibits an altered nutritional 
environment, generated in part by host-mediated iron limitation (Deriu et al., 2013; 
Raffatellu et al., 2009) (Figure 2b). Gut inflammation is also frequently associated with the 
loss of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in favor of a bloom of Gammaproteobacteria (usually 
members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Figure 3c) (Baumler and Sperandio, 2016). Overall, the 
observed decreases in microbial diversity generally lead to, and sometimes overtly favor, 
pathogen outgrowth. Lcn2 is highly upregulated in the gut as part of the inflammatory 
response to restrict blooms of harmful microbes (Moschen et al., 2016; Raffatellu et al., 
2009), for instance during chronic intestinal inflammation. In this context, Lcn2 greatly 
prevented the exacerbation of colitis and spontaneous colonic tumor formation by impeding 
the growth of enterobactin-utilizing, pro-colitogenic bacterial species in mice (Figure 3c) 
(Moschen et al., 2016). Nevertheless, some successful enterobacterial pathogens, including 
Salmonella, Klebsiella and pathogenic E. coli, circumvent Lcn2-mediated iron restriction by 
secreting stealth siderophores including salmochelin, which cannot be sequestered by Lcn2 
(Figure 2b) (Bachman et al., 2012; Fischbach et al., 2006; Flo et al., 2004; Raffatellu et al., 
2009).

It is worth noting that Lcn2 can also restrict the growth of enterobactin-secreting commensal 
bacteria (Figure 2b). However, certain members of the commensal microbiota have, similar 
to pathogens, evolved resistance to some host antimicrobial responses. For example, 
beneficial species including EcN, Bifidobacterium spp., and Lactobacillus spp. exhibit some 
resistance to host-mediated iron limitation (Deriu et al., 2013; Vega-Bautista et al., 2019). 
Intriguingly, the aforementioned microbes have been administered as probiotics for a long 
time, despite the mechanistic basis of their beneficial properties being unknown. Recent 
studies, however, have shed light on some of these mechanisms. The probiotic EcN employs 
multiple systems to acquire iron from the intestinal environment, including multiple 
siderophores (enterobactin, yersiniabactin, aerobactin, salmochelin) (Valdebenito et al., 
2006). These mechanisms of iron acquisition collectively increase EcN’s ability to compete 
with other microbes, including Salmonella, during colitis (Deriu et al., 2013) (Figure 3b). 
Siderophore cross-feeding between different bacterial taxa offers another mechanism for 
commensals to obtain iron. For example, B. thetaiotaomicron, a member of the phylum 
Bacteroidetes, pirates xenosiderophores from commensal and pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae

(phylum Proteobacteria) in the inflamed gut, thereby contributing to the resilience of the 
commensal gut microbiota (Zhu et al., 2020) (Figure 3b).

Some studies in model organisms have proposed that the host might benefit from microbe-
associated iron metabolism and sensing. A study by Qi et al. demonstrated that enterobactin 
produced by commensal E. coli increased mitochondrial iron levels and promoted growth of 
the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (Qi and Han, 2018). Another study reported that intestinal 
commensals such as Lactobacillus spp. can sense levels of iron in the gut and subsequently 
modulate the host’s systemic iron metabolism. Here, microbe-derived metabolites 
suppressed the host transcription factor HIF-2α and increased the expression of ferritin, 
thereby reducing systemic iron overload in an experimental model of hemochromatosis (Das 
et al., 2020). The microbiota has also been shown to modulate host expression of hepcidin in 
the gut (Bessman et al., 2020). In this study, commensal microbes were shown to induce 
hepcidin expression in dendritic cells, which in turn promoted iron sequestration by 
macrophages. In addition to modulating gut microbiota composition, this process also 
contributed to mucosal healing in an experimental IBD model (Bessman et al., 2020).

5.2. 

Iron in the context of inflammatory bowel disease

IBD, including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), comprises a heterogeneous 
spectrum of chronic and/or relapsing episodes of intestinal inflammation. Alterations of the 
gut microbiota and microbial interactions with the perturbed mucosal barrier are prominent 
features of IBD (Caruso et al., 2020). The inflamed gut mucosa is also responsible for 
chronic GI blood loss and reduced intestinal iron absorption, which is frequently 
accompanied by iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease (Nielsen et al., 2018). Iron 
supplementation in anemic IBD patients, however, differs from standard approaches, and 
several considerations need to be taken into account (outlined in (Nielsen et al., 2018)).

In animal models of IBD, it has been shown that high concentrations of luminal iron or 
heme iron alter gut microbial communities, further exacerbating the bloom of 
Gammaproteobacteria and worsening colitis (Constante et al., 2017; Mahalhal et al.; Werner 
et al., 2011) (Figure 3c). Importantly, these effects were only observed when iron was 
administered orally, whereas intravenous iron did not induce such changes. These findings 
are in line with a study in IBD patients, showing that oral iron therapy is associated with 
distinct and unfavorable changes in gut microbial ecology (Lee et al., 2017).

In stark contrast to these findings, a recently published study demonstrated that a short 
course of dietary iron supplementation attenuated the virulence of an enteric pathogen 
(Sanchez et al., 2018). Following infection of mice with the murine pathogen Citrobacter 
rodentium, a common model for human enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and 
enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) infections, dietary iron supplementation promoted host 
survival by increasing intestinal glucose content and insulin resistance. Elevated glucose 
resulted in suppression of virulence factors in the pathogen, which resulted in the pathogen 
colonizing, but not killing, its host. This phenomenon was termed a ‘cooperative response’ 
by the authors (Sanchez et al., 2018). Although iron supplementation during infection has 
previously been shown to be detrimental to humans and model organisms by promoting the 
growth of pathogens, it is possible that oral iron supplementation may promote such a

cooperative response in some contexts of localized infection or microbiota composition. 
Future studies are needed to show whether this result applies to other microbes and in the 
context of other hosts.

In patients with ileal CD, a distinct pathovar of E. coli is abnormally prevalent. Termed 
adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), these mucosa-associated bacteria are able to adhere to and 
invade intestinal epithelial cells, a process that likely contributes to the progression of CD 
(Shaler et al., 2019). In addition to other virulence factors, iron metabolism likely plays a 
key role in AIEC’s pathogenicity (Figure 3c). Iron acquisition systems that are most 
frequently found in pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae, such as the synthesis and uptake of 
yersiniabactin and salmochelin, are present in many AIEC strains. Moreover, the presence of 
a heme acquisition system correlates with AIEC’s intracellular persistence in macrophages 
(Dogan et al., 2014). Notably, there are currently no treatments available that specifically 
eradicate CD-associated AIEC from the gut of these patients. Although the gut microbiota 
plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD, current standard treatments focus on targeting 
the immune system rather than the intestinal microbiota. Routine administration of 
antibiotics in IBD patients remains controversial because it further disrupts the gut 
microbiota, promoting bacterial dysbiosis. Moreover, antibiotics have been linked to 
potentiating AIEC infection and outgrowth (Shaler et al., 2019). Thus, antimicrobial 
strategies that selectively target pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae in IBD are highly desirable. 
Because iron metabolism is an important virulence factor for IBD-associated bacteria, 
developing strategies to impede pathogenic iron metabolism could be useful.

Iron metabolism in the respiratory and genito-urinary tract

6.1.  The respiratory tract

Bacterial communities of the respiratory tract are more dynamic, albeit less well 
characterized, than those of the gut (Huffnagle et al., 2017). Similar to the gut, however, iron 
acquisition is also important for bacterial pathogens that infect the airways. 
Correspondingly, Lcn2 is also highly upregulated in human pulmonary tissue during 
bacterial pneumonia (Warszawska et al., 2013). However, whether this increased expression 
of Lcn2 results in beneficial or detrimental outcomes strongly depends on the pathogen. The 
Gram-negative pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial pneumonia 
and sepsis. Clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae have been shown to either produce 
enterobactin alone, or a combination of enterobactin, salmochelin, and yersiniabactin 
(Bachman et al., 2011). Whereas salmochelin and yersiniabactin enabled K. pneumoniae 
isolates to evade Lcn2-mediated iron sequestration and to disseminate systemically, Lcn2 
conferred substantial protection against isolates that only produce enterobactin (Bachman et 
al., 2012). Of note, siderophores in this context also exhibited a noncanonical role by acting 
directly on the host to induce inflammatory cytokines (Holden et al., 2016). In contrast to K. 
pneumoniae, the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most prevalent 
bacterial cause of respiratory tract infections, acquires iron via hemoproteins instead of 
siderophores. Furthermore, instead of helping the host, increased Lcn2 expression worsened 
the outcome of S. pneumoniae infection by skewing macrophage polarization towards an 
anti-inflammatory phenotype (Warszawska et al., 2013). The differing impact of Lcn2 in

these examples highlights the protein’s context-dependent roles during infection, which stem 
from its siderophore-neutralizing and immunomodulatory properties.

Increased iron levels have been observed in the sputum of patients with the chronic 
pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis (CF), which has implications for a range of CF-related 
bacterial and fungal pathogens (Tyrrell and Callaghan, 2016). For example, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa is a frequent cause of CF exacerbations, and studies have shown that this 
pathogen has a plethora of iron acquisition systems, including heme uptake and the 
production of siderophores such as pyoverdine and pyochelin (Minandri et al., 2016; Vasil 
and Ochsner, 1999).

6.2.  The genitourinary tract

Similar to other mucosal sites, the genitourinary tract is colonized by microbes, although 
distinct differences exist between males and females (Gottschick et al., 2017). The healthy 
female vaginal microbiota is largely dominated by members of the lactic acid-producing 
bacteria Lactobacillus spp. (Huttenhower et al., 2012). These iron-independent commensals 
together with host-derived Lf represent essential factors to maintain a healthy vaginal 
environment. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder in women of reproductive age 
and is predominantly caused by Gardnerella vaginalis. Besides BV, G. vaginalis can also 
cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), amniotic infections, and pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Numerous iron-acquisition mechanisms have been shown for this pathogen, including 
siderophore and heme utilization as well as Lf uptake (Jarosik et al., 1998).

UTIs are another common infectious disease in otherwise healthy women, which is 
complicated by the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the 
primary cause of such infections, and iron acquisition gene clusters have been identified as 
important virulence factors to successfully colonize the urinary tract (Garcia et al., 2011; 
Mike et al., 2016). Lcn2 is secreted by the urinary tract mucosa of women with UTI and 
represents a colonization barrier that pathogens must overcome (Steigedal et al., 2014). 
UPEC is able to successfully colonize this environment by importing heme and by deploying 
the stealth siderophores salmochelin, yersiniabactin, and aerobactin (Garcia et al., 2011; 
Mike et al., 2016). In light of recent findings indicating the presence of a urinary tract 
microbiome (the so-called urobiome) (Wolfe and Brubaker, 2019), future studies may 
elucidate mechanisms of competition for iron between pathogens and the urobiome.

7.  Exploiting microbial iron acquisition for therapy and diagnosis

As many pathogens require iron during infection, their means of iron acquisition constitute 
attractive therapeutic targets (Figure 4). For example, as described above, many pathogens 
require siderophores for iron uptake. As such, siderophore immunization might be a 
promising approach to limit microbial iron acquisition during infection. To this end, 
immunization against yersiniabactin and aerobactin in the context of UTIs protected from 
systemic infection with UPEC (Figure 4a) (Mike et al., 2016). Similarly, immunization with 
the siderophore enterobactin, which resulted in the production of antibodies against both 
enterobactin and salmochelin, protected against intestinal Salmonella infection (Figure 4a) 
(Sassone-Corsi et al., 2016a). Intriguingly, the reduced Salmonella burden in enterobactin-

immunized mice was paralleled by increased levels of Lactobacillus spp. This could be due 
to a growth advantage of Lactobacillus over other commensals in the inflamed, iron-
deprived intestine, although the overall impact of enterobactin immunization on the gut 
microbiota warrants further investigation.

Another way to exploit siderophore-mediated iron acquisition is by employing “Trojan 
horse” antimicrobials, wherein an antimicrobial molecule is conjugated to a natural product 
that is taken up by the targeted microbe. Although such compounds can be generated in the 
lab, it is worth noting that siderophore-antibiotic conjugates exist in nature; these so-called 
sideromycins constitute important fitness factors as they mediate microbial competition in 
nutrient-limited environments (Braun et al., 2009). One class of sideromycins are the 
microcins, which are comprised of an antibacterial peptide that is covalently attached to a 
siderophore (Braun et al., 2009). By secreting microcins, EcN is able to inhibit the growth of 
enteric pathogens during intestinal inflammation without broadly affecting the gut 
microbiota (Figure 4a, panel II) (Sassone-Corsi et al., 2016b). Inspired by sideromycins that 
exhibit narrow-spectrum activity, researchers have generated synthetic siderophore-antibiotic 
conjugates with the goal of more specifically targeting pathogens. For example, conjugating 
enterobactin to the broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin yielded a narrow-spectrum 
antibacterial compound. This molecule only targeted E. coli that express the salmochelin 
system’s IroD esterase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes enterobactin and salmochelin, and is thus 
predicted to preferentially target pathogens instead of commensals (Neumann et al., 2018) 
(Figure 4b, panel I).

In addition to being a target for antimicrobial therapy, siderophores can be used directly as 
therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Desferrioxamine B (desferal), a siderophore naturally 
produced by Streptomyces spp., is an iron chelator approved for use in humans to treat iron 
overload syndromes. Siderophores are also being investigated for use in the molecular 
imaging of bacterial and fungal infections (Petrik et al., 2017) (Figure 4c). As a proof of 
principle, the Aspergillus siderophore triacetylfusarinine C was labeled with a positron-
emitting gallium radioisotope (68Ga), then injected into mice and imaged by positron 
emission tomography (PET) to detect localization of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus 
fumigatus (Haas et al., 2015). This approach could be helpful to better diagnose and monitor 
infectious agents in complex disease scenarios.

8.  Conclusions

With antimicrobial resistance posing an increasing threat to humans, alternative strategies to 
combat infections are in urgent need. As iron is a key micronutrient for most microbes, its 
abundance is tightly controlled by the host in order to restrict microbial growth. In addition 
to host-encoded mechanisms of iron sequestration, the microbiota also contributes to reduce 
iron availability to pathogens. Thus, to colonize the host, pathogens often deploy a variety of 
virulence factors that evade or subvert these iron-withholding mechanisms. Targeting 
microbial iron metabolism and virulence factors associated with iron acquisition hold 
promise as therapeutic strategies to reduce pathogen colonization and limit the severity of 
infection. Furthermore, such strategies could be advantageous for shifting the composition 
of the microbiota at mucosal surfaces by promoting the growth of beneficial microbes (e.g.,

Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp.). These properties are particularly attractive in the 
context of diseases with underlying dysbiosis, including IBD. Collectively, iron metabolism 
at the host-microbe interface constitutes an important area for future investigations and for 
the potential development of novel therapeutics.

Figure 1. Evasion of Lcn2-mediated antimicrobial activity.
Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae can secrete siderophores such as enterobactin and 
salmochelin into the intestinal lumen to scavenge iron from the host environment. Some 
immune cells (e.g., neutrophils) and epithelial cells (in response to cytokines including 
interleukin-22) produce Lcn2, which sequesters enterobactin and thus limits the growth of 
enterobactin-dependent bacteria by depriving them of iron. In contrast, salmochelin and 
other ‘stealth’ siderophores enable certain bacteria (mostly pathogens) to evade Lcn2-
dependent iron limitation.

Figure 2. Model of host-microbe competition for iron in the gut during homeostasis and disease.
(a) Under homeostatic conditions, members of the commensal microbiota acquire iron in the 
form of heme or by scavenging ferric iron with siderophores such as enterobactin. Low 
levels of antimicrobial proteins including lactoferrin (Lf) and lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) are present 
in the gut lumen. Lf sequesters luminal ferric iron, whereas Lcn2 sequesters iron-laden 
enterobactin. (b) Antibiotic treatment, infection and inflammation can induce IL-22-
mediated secretion of Lcn2 from intestinal epithelial cells, and of Lcn2 and Lf from 
neutrophils that are recruited to the gut. The consequent iron limitation, in turn, induces 
commensals and pathogens to upregulate various iron uptake mechanisms, including 
increasing production and secretion of siderophores. Many enteric pathogens secrete stealth 
siderophores that promote evasion of lipocalin-2-mediated iron sequestration, thus enabling 
these pathogens to outcompete the gut microbiota and thrive.

Figure 3. Iron acquisition by pathogens and commensals.
(a) In the healthy gut, the microbiota is primarily comprised of obligate anaerobes (the phyla 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes). These commensals occupy local niches, consume luminal 
nutrients and uptake iron (Fe), thereby providing colonization resistance to pathogenic 
microbes. (b) Intestinal inflammation causes a dramatic reduction in luminal Fe content. The 
enteric pathogen Salmonella is able to scavenge Fe3+ in this environment, due to the 
production of salmochelin. However, secretion of multiple siderophores enables the 
probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917 to outcompete Salmonella. Moreover, the 
commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sustains colonization during 
inflammation by utilizing xenosiderophores, a critical mechanism to restore its original 
colonization state after inflammation is resolved. (c) IBD is characterized by chronic 
relapsing or remittent intestinal inflammation. During colitis, the increased secretion of host 
antimicrobial proteins lactoferrin (Lf) and lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) limits the availability of iron to 
gut microbes. However, the low Fe content induces the upregulation of bacterial Fe uptake 
genes, which contributes to the blooms of Proteobacteria frequently observed. Even high 
luminal Fe content (e.g., due to Fe supplementation) promotes the growth of Proteobacteria 
in the inflamed gut. In patients with Crohn’s disease, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) 
strains express a variety of Fe-uptake genes, which contribute to the pathogen’s growth 
during colitis.

Figure 4. Siderophores as therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools.
(a) During infection, various siderophores are secreted by pathogens to thrive in the host 
despite host-mediated iron limitation. In experimental models, siderophores have been 
targeted for vaccination by linkage to a carrier protein in order to generate anti-siderophore 
antibodies. Whereas pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, UPEC) were able to successfully replicate 
in naïve hosts, siderophore-based immunization reduced their colonization levels. (b) 
Conjugation of antimicrobial peptides or antibiotics to siderophores. (b.I) An enterobactin-
ciprofloxacin conjugate is transported through a common siderophore receptor found in the 
outer membrane of all E. coli strains. Once in the cytoplasm, the IroD esterase, which is 
mainly found in pathogenic E. coli strains, processes the enterobactin-ciprofloxacin prodrug 
and thereby enables ciprofloxacin-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis. (b.II) Certain 
strains of Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli Nissle or K. pneumoniae, secrete microcins in 
response to nutrient (e.g., Fe) limitation. It is generally thought that the siderophore moiety 
enables these small antimicrobial peptides to better target susceptible strains of 
Enterobacteriaceae by utilizing their siderophore receptors for import. (c) Microbial 
siderophore uptake during infection can be leveraged for imaging applications. During lung 
infection, Aspergillus scavenges iron (Fe) via siderophores. Injection of siderophores 
radiolabeled with 68Ga in experimental Aspergillus infections enabled the visualization of 
the lung infection site by PET/CT.
